Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall.

The maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to your caster level, to a maximum of 5 HD at 5th level. You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself.      You retain your own ability scores. Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the same. You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).      You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels, but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels.      If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components.      You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.      You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.      You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form. Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form. You cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn't change the creature type or subtype.      You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.      When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms at the time of reversion are still held in the same way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its true form.          ",

The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.      An _antimagic field_ suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within an _antimagic field_ counts against the suppressed spell's duration.      Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an _antimagic field_. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast _antimagic field_ in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an _antimagic field_ because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)      A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. _dispel magic_ does not remove the field.      Two or more _antimagic fields_ sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as _wall of force_,  _prismatic sphere_, and _prismatic wall_,  remain unaffected by _antimagic field_ (see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.      Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.          ",

You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.      You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.      While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.      You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as _dispel magic_ cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).

If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, _atonement_ operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject's burden. Many casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see _geas/quest_) or similar penance to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before casting the _atonement_ spell on its behalf.      _atonement_ may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected.      _Reverse Magical Alignment Change:_ If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, _atonement_ returns its alignment to its original status at no cost in experience points.      _Restore Class:_ A paladin who has lost her class features due to committing an evil act may have her paladinhood restored to her by this spell.      _Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers:_ A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of his or her deity may regain that ability by seeking _atonement_ from another cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric loses 500 XP for his intercession. If the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose XP.      _Redemption or Temptation:_ You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.      Though the spell description refers to evil acts, _atonement_ can also be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts are evil, good, chaotic, or lawful.      _Note:_ Normally, changing alignment is up to the player. This use of _atonement_ simply offers a believable way for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.          ",

The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level.\r      You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts _suggestion_, your caster level for this casting of _binding_ increases by 1. For each assistant who casts _dominate animal_,  _dominate person_,  or _dominate monster_,  your caster level for this casting of _binding_ increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a _binding_ spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the _binding_ spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the _binding_ lasts. All _binding_ spells are dismissible.\r      Regardless of the version of _binding_ you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.\r      If you are casting any of the first three versions of _binding_ (those with limited durations), you may cast additional _binding_ spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature succeeds on this save, all the _binding_ spells it has received are broken.\r      The _binding_ spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.\r      _Chaining:_ The subject is confined by restraints that generate an _Antipathy_ spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this form of _binding_ is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.\r      _Slumber:_ This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while _slumbering_, nor does it age. This form of _binding_ is more difficult to cast than _chaining_, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1.\r      _Bound Slumber:_ This combination of _chaining_ and _slumber_ lasts for as long as one month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2.\r      _Hedged Prison:_ The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3.\r      _Metamorphosis:_ The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The _binding_ is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while _metamorphosed_, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.\r      _Minimus Containment:_ The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The _binding_ is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while _contained_, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.\r      You can't dispel a _binding_ spell with _dispel magic_ or a similar effect, though an _antimagic field_ or _Mage's disjunction_ affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to _dismissal_,  _banishment_,  or a similar effect.\r      In addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of _binding_ (cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.\r      \rThe components for a binding spell vary according to the version of the spell.",

You look as though you're winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random.      _Blinking_ has several effects, as follows.      Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).      If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.      Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're _Blinking_ unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.      While _blinking_, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC.      You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.      While _blinking_, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.)      Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.      An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.      An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.      Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.          ",

If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.

When the clone is completed, the original's soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead. The clone is physically identical with the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original.

If this Constitution adjustment would give the clone a Constitution score of 0, the spell fails. If the original creature has lost levels since the flesh sample was taken and died at a lower level than the clone would otherwise be, the clone is one level below the level at which the original died.      The spell duplicates only the original's body and mind, not its equipment.

A living creature with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud).      A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud (a successful Fortitude save halves this damage).

Unlike a _fog cloud_, the _cloudkill_ moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground.      Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.      Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.          ",

This swarm forms a living aura around the character to a radius of 10 feet. The character is immune to his or her own _crown of vermin_. The swarm goes where the character goes at his or her speed, even if the character takes to the air or water (though water drowns the vermin after 1 full round of immersion, unless the spell is cast underwater, in which case aquatic or marine vermin answer the call and cannot leave the water). Each vermin in the _crown of vermin_ bites a creature who enters the area occupied by the effect (or the character forces the effect into an area occupied by another creature) for 1 point of damage, and then dies. Each victim takes enough points of damage to kill it, destroying that number of vermin in the process. Victims get a Reflex saving throw each round to avoid the full press, and if successful, take only 10d10 bites (and 10d10 points of damage). A total of 1,000 points of damage can be dealt to those who fall prey to the _crown of vermin_. The vermin have damage reduction 1/epic, so the vermin's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If there aren't enough vermin to kill all the creatures in the spell's effect, the creature with the fewest hit points is affected first, then the creature with the second fewest hit points, and so on. After all creatures that can be killed have been killed, any remaining damage is distributed among the survivors equally.      The character has utter control over the vermin in his or her aura, and can force them into areas that would normally deter common vermin. The character can completely suppress his or her vermin aura as a free action so that no vermin are visible at all. The time that vermin are suppressed does not count toward the spell's duration. Alternatively, the character can roughly shape and move the vermin in any fashion he or she desires within the limits of the 10-foot-radius spread as a move-equivalent action. The vermin cannot be wrested from the character's control through any means. The vermin make all saving throws to avoid damaging effects using the character's base saving throw bonuses. They gain the character's spell resistance, if any, and they get saving throws against spells that would otherwise automatically slay vermin.

      "description": "      You can use _dispel magic_ to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by _dispel magic_. _dispel magic_ can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.      _Note:_ The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the _dispel magic_ can take effect.      You choose to use _dispel magic_ in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:      _Targeted Dispel:_ One object, creature, or spell is the target of the _dispel magic_ spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level. If you succeed on a particular check, that spell is dispelled; if you fail, that spell remains in effect.      If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by _monster summoning_), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.      If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a _bag of holding_) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.      You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.      _Area Dispel:_ When _dispel magic_ is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.      For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the _dispel magic_ spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.      For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.      For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the _dispel magic_ spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.      For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the _dispel magic_ spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.      If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by _monster summoning_) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.      You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.      _Counterspell:_ When _dispel magic_ is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, _dispel magic_ may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.          ",

      "description": "      You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind.      If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as 'Come here,' 'Go there,' 'Fight,' and 'Stand still.' You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.      Once you have given a _dominated_ creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description).      Changing your instructions or giving a _dominated_ creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.      By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on.      Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.      If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.      _Protection from evil_ or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it.

The communication is one-way. The recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the messenger gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient.      Once the message is delivered, the messenger's mind returns instantly to its body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the messenger to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message.      If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the messenger can choose to wake up (ending the spell) or remain in the trance. The messenger can remain in the trance until the recipient goes to sleep, then enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message as normal. A messenger that is disturbed during the trance comes awake, ending the spell.      Creatures who don't sleep (such as elves, but not half-elves) or don't dream cannot be contacted by this spell.      The messenger is unaware of its own surroundings or of the activities around it while in the trance. It is defenseless both physically and mentally (always fails any saving throw) while in the trance.          ",

The character can take more than one creature along (subject to the character's weight limit), but all must be touching each other.

For every minute the character moves through the dream landscape, he or she can 'wake' to find him or her self five miles displaced in the waking world. The character does not know precisely where he or she will come out in the waking world, nor the conditions of the waking world through which the character travels. The character knows approximately where he or she will end up based on time spent traveling in dream. _Dreamscape_ can also be used to travel to other planes that contain creatures that dream, but doing this requires crossing into the dreams of outsiders, where the character is subject to the dangers of alien dream realities. This is a potentially perilous proposition. Transferring to another plane of existence requires 1d4 hours of uninterrupted journey. Any creatures touched by the character when _Dreamscape_ is cast also make the transition to the borders of unconscious thought. They may opt to follow the character, wander off into the dreams of others, or stumble back into the waking world (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by the character).

The shock knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an _earthquake_ spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.      _Cave_,  _Cavern_,  _or Tunnel:_ The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half ) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An _earthquake_ cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.      _Cliffs: Earthquake_ causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).      _Open Ground:_ Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.      _Structure:_ Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).      _River_,  _Lake_,  _or Marsh:_ Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.      _Pinned beneath Rubble:_ Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.          ",

No matter how many negative levels the character bestows on him or her self, the eidolon can never have more character levels than the character has (taking the negative levels into account).

The eidolon is considered fresh and rested when created. It may cast any spell the character has access to, including an epic spell. Use the eidolon's Spellcraft modifier as the basis for the number of epic spells it can cast in a day, and its effective character level as a basis for its skills, feats, and other abilities. The eidolon is effectively lower level than the character and probably can't cast all the spells he or she knows. A powerful enough eidolon might conceivably cast the _eidolon_ spell itself. The eidolon appears in whatever mundane clothing the character desires when initially conjured, but it has no other possessions. It shares part of the character's soul, so it is the character for all intents and purposes. The character and his or her _eidolon_ communicate with each other normally.

The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a -1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size.      A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the target's speed.      If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it- the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.      All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any _enlarged_ item that leaves an _enlarged_ creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them. Magical properties of _enlarged_ items are not increased by this spell.

The heckling ends the spell if this check result beats your Charisma check result. Only one such challenge is allowed per use of the spell.      If any member of the audience is attacked or subjected to some other overtly hostile act, the spell ends and the previously _enthralled_ members become immediately unfriendly toward you.

However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.      The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth.      You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall. Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round. You may even cast this spell when it isn't your turn.      This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.      _Feather fall_ works only upon free-falling objects.

      "description": "      Casting a _gate_ spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.      Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the _gate_.      The _gate_ itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.      A _gate_ has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the _gate_ from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.      _Planar Travel:_ As a mode of planar travel, a _gate_ spell functions much like a _plane shift_ spell, except that the _gate_ opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a _gate_ from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you-anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A _gate_ cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.      You may hold the _gate_ open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.      _Calling Creatures:_ The second effect of the _gate_ spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the _gate_ to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the _gate_,  although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a _gate_ that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).      If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.      A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature's help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.      If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the _lesser planar ally_ spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in 'livestock' rather than in coin, which could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.      Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.      _Note:_ When you use a calling spell such as _gate_ to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.

A character can only cast this spell while on the Ethereal Plane. When he or she casts the spell, a local density fluctuation precipitates the creation of a demiplane. At first, the fledgling plane grows at a rate of 1 foot in radius per day to an initial maximum radius of 180 feet as it rapidly draws substance from surrounding ethereal vapors and protomatter.      The spellcaster determines the environment within the demiplane when he or she first casts _genesis_,  reflecting most any desire the spellcaster can visualize. The spellcaster determines factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain. This spell cannot create life (including vegetation), nor can it create construction (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth). The spellcaster must add these things in some other fashion if he or she desires. Once the basic demiplane reaches its maximum size, the spellcaster can continue to cast this spell to enlarge the demiplane, adding another 180 feet of radius to the demiplane each time.    ",

A _glyph of warding_ can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.      You set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, _glyphs_ can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. _glyphs_ can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. _glyphs_ respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple _glyphs_ cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three drawers, each can be separately warded.      When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A _glyph_ can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the _glyph_ and tracery become nearly invisible.      _glyphs_ cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. _Mislead_, _polymorph_, and _nondetection_ (and similar magical effects) can fool a _glyph_, though nonmagical disguises and the like can't. _Read magic_ allows you to identify a _glyph of warding_ with a DC 13 Spellcraft check. Identifying the _glyph_ does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the _glyph_ (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored).      _Note:_ Magic traps such as _glyph of warding_ are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the _glyph_ and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for _glyph of warding_.      Depending on the version selected, a _glyph_ either blasts the intruder or activates a spell.      _Blast Glyph:_ A _blast glyph_ deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster's choice, made at time of casting). Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect.      _Spell Glyph:_ You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the _glyph_. If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving throws and spell resistance operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the spell stored in the _glyph_.          ",

The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area.      _Fog:_ Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.      _Arcane Locks:_ All doors in the warded area are _arcane locked_. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.      _Webs:_ Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created by the _web_ spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the _guards and wards_ spell lasts. Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text for _web_. Spell Resistance: No.      _Confusion:_ Where there are choices in direction-such as a corridor intersection or side passage-a minor _confusion-_type effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is an enchantment, mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: Yes.      _Lost Doors:_ One door per caster level is covered by a _silent image_ to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with). Spell Resistance: No.      In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects.      1. _Dancing lights_ in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the _guards and wards_ spell lasts. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.      2. A _magic mouth_ in two places. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No.      3. A _stinking cloud_ in two places. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the _guards and wards_ spell lasts. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text for _stinking cloud_. Spell Resistance: No.      4. A _gust of wind_ in one corridor or room. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates. Spell Resistance: Yes.      5. A _suggestion_ in one place. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the _suggestion_ mentally. Saving Throw: Will negates. Spell Resistance: Yes.      The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A _dispel magic_ cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.

The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before it at a speed of as much as 240 feet per round. Once the hand leads the subject back to you, it disappears.      The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any particular way toward you. If the subject chooses not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on her own devices to locate you.

If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject.      If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no subject that matches the description within 5 miles, it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such creature was found), and disappears.      The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is invisible to anyone except you and a potential subject. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating a subject and leading it back to you. The hand can't pass through solid objects but can ooze through small cracks and slits.

This floating, disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two of you, regardless of where you move or how the opponent tries to get around it, providing cover (+4 AC) for you against that opponent. Nothing can fool the hand-it sticks with the selected opponent in spite of darkness, invisibility, polymorphing, or any other attempt at hiding or disguise. The hand does not pursue an opponent, however.      An _interposing hand_ is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points as you do when you're undamaged, and its AC is 20 (-1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don't cause damage do not affect it.      The hand never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents. It cannot push through a _wall of force_ or enter an _antimagic field_, but it suffers the full effect of a _prismatic wall_ or _prismatic sphere_. The hand makes saving throws as its caster.      _Disintegrate_ or a successful _dispel magic_ destroys it.      Any creature weighing 2,000 pounds or less that tries to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed. The hand cannot reduce the speed of a creature weighing more than 2,000 pounds, but it still affects the creature's attacks.      Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.          ",

If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.      Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.      Of course, the subject is not magically _silenced_,  and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as _bless_ that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.      _Invisibility_ can be made permanent (on objects only) with a _permanency_ spell.

For 20 rounds, the dream larva's body physically replaces the character's, though the dream larva has the character's equipment. The dream larva is free to call on all its own powers and abilities, or use the character's equipment. The character's consciousness and physical form are suppressed for the duration of the possession. The character has no way to dismiss the spell, communicate, or otherwise maintain awareness once possession has commenced. The dream larva, temporarily freed from its imprisonment in some distant nightmare, will attempt to slay and incapacitate any creature it can see or find, whether it is a friend or foe of the caster. Casting _lord of nightmares_ entails some risk for the caster, since it's unknown what a dream larva might do over the course of 20 rounds. The larva will dispatch all enemies it can find before turning to its own concerns. Sometimes a dream larva will attempt to place itself in a dangerous or precarious situation prior to the end of the spell, leaving the caster to extricate him or herself. If the dream larva is slain during the duration of the spell, the character's consciousness is instantly restored to aware-ness within his or her own body. The character's condition remains what it was when he or she completed casting _lord of nightmares_, regardless of what damage the dream larva received. However, magic item charges used, potions consumed, and other physical resources used up by the dream larva are permanent.          ",

The sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but _dispel magic_, _disintegrate_, a _sphere of annihilation_, or a _rod of cancellation_ affects it. The sword's AC is 13 (10, +0 size bonus for Medium object, +3 deflection bonus).      If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time _Mage's sword_ strikes it. If the sword is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the sword has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.          ",

      "description": "      All creatures within the area gain the effects of a _protection from evil_ spell, and no nongood summoned creatures can enter the area either. You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of _protection from evil_), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.      This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A _magic circle against evil_ can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the _lesser planar binding_,  _planar binding_,  and _greater planar binding_ spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the _magic circle_. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal _protection from evil_ spell for that creature only.      A _magic circle_ leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (_astral projection_,  _blink_,  _dimension door_,  _etherealness_,  _gate_,  _plane shift_,  _shadow walk_,  _teleport_,  and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a _dimensional anchor_ spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the _anchor_ effect lasts as long as the _magic circle_ does. The creature cannot reach across the _magic circle_,  but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.      You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the _magic circle_ more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.      A successful diagram allows you to cast a _dimensional anchor_ spell on the _magic circle_ during the round before casting any summoning spell. The _anchor_ holds any called creatures in the _magic circle_ for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a _magic circle_ prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the _lesser planar binding_ spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.      This spell is not cumulative with _protection from evil_ and vice versa.          ",

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the _magic jar_. You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty.      To cast the spell, the _magic jar_ must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.      While in the _magic jar_,  you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.)      You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.      Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by _protection from evil_ or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the _magic jar_ unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the _magic jar_,  and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.      If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the _magic jar_. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.      As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the _magic jar_ if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.      If the host body is slain, you return to the _magic jar_,  if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.      If the spell ends while you are in the _magic jar_,  you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the _magic jar_ returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the _magic jar_ or at the host's location.          ",

The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, _Magic mouth_ can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.      The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical _darkness_ or _invisibility_ does. Silent movement or magical _silence_ defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible.

These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other figment or you. You can move into and through a _mirror image_. When you and the _mirror image_ separate, observers can't use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The figments may also move through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.      Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful attack against an image destroys it. An image's AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dex modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they're burned or dead after being hit by a _fireball_).

The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor can you see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease. A _gem of true seeing_ or similar magic reveals the presence of a _phase door_ but does not allow its use.      A _phase door_ is subject to _dispel magic_. If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, he is harmlessly ejected just as if he were inside a _passwall_ effect.      You can allow other creatures to use the _phase door_ by setting some triggering condition for the door. Such conditions can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. They can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.

      "description": "      By casting this spell, you request your deity to send you an elemental or outsider (of 6 HD or less) of the deity's choice. If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway).      You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple to the complex. You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services.      The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.      A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to one day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.      A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment.      At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).      _Note:_ When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.

      "description": "      Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, which must lie within the spell's range. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.      To create the trap, you must use a _magic circle_ spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.      The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A _dimensional anchor_ cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see _magic circle against evil_) to make the trap more secure.      If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you.      Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free. Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.      When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.          ",

If the original form didn't have a Wisdom or Charisma score, it gains those scores as appropriate for the new form.      Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature. In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force.      A nonmagical object cannot be made into a magic item with this spell. Magic items aren't affected by this spell.      This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or adamantine. It also cannot reproduce the special properties of cold iron in order to overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures.      This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of _baleful polymorph_,  _polymorph_,  _flesh to stone_, _stone to flesh_, _transmute mud to rock_, _transmute metal to wood_,  or _transmute rock to mud_.

It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. _Prestidigitation_ can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a _Prestidigitation_ spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, a _Prestidigitation_ lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.          ",

      "description": "      This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.      First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.      Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a _magic jar_ attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as _dominate person_). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the _protection from evil_ effect. If the _protection from evil_ effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.      Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.          ",

This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means. A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised, in addition to losing spells for losing a level.

If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.      Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete.  When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.      A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject's level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1. If the subject was 1st level, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2. (If this reduction would put its Con at 0 or lower, it can't be reincarnated). This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means.      It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is well advised to become a multiclass character.      For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the following table. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.      A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell.  Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated.

Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as eight creatures (of any size). Creatures in the space can pull the rope up into the space, making the rope 'disappear.' In that case, the rope counts as one of the eight creatures that can fit in the space. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A weight greater than that can pull the rope free.      Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot-by- 5-foot window were centered on the rope. The window is present on the Material Plane, but it's invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can't see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. The _rope trick_ spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space.      _Note:_ It is hazardous to create an extradimensional space within an existing extradimensional space or to take an extradimensional space into an existing one.

If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you.      The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) You can have but one pair of these chests at any given time-even a _wish_ spell does not allow more. The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be.      To hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After sixty days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a _wish_ spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.

      "description": "      This seed uses whichever one of five energy types the caster chooses: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The caster can cast the energy forth as a bolt, imbue an object with the energy, or create a freestanding manifestation of the energy. If the spell developed using the _energy_ seed releases a bolt, that bolt instantaneously deals 10d6 points of damage of the appropriate energy type, and all in the bolt's area must make a Reflex save for half damage. For each additional 1d6 points of damage dealt, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. The bolt begins at the caster's fingertips. To imbue another creature with the ability to use an energy bolt as a spell-like ability at its option or when a particular condition is met, increase the Spellcraft DC by +25. The caster can also cause a creature or object to emanate the specific energy type out to a radius of 10 feet for 20 hours. The emanated energy deals 2d6 points of energy damage per round against unprotected creatures (the target creature is susceptible if not separately warded or otherwise resistant to the energy). For each additional 1d6 points of damage emanated, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. The caster may also create a wall, half-circle, circle, dome, or sphere of the desired energy that emanates the energy for up to 20 hours. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of energy, dealing 2d4 points of energy damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of energy damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and in each round that a creature enters or remains in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6+20 points of energy damage to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures. For each additional 1d4 points of damage, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2.      The caster can also use the _energy_ seed to create a spell that carefully releases and balances the emanation of cold, electricity, and fire, creating specific weather effects for a period of 20 hours. Using the _energy_ seed this way has a base Spellcraft DC of 25. The area extends to a two-mile-radius centered on the caster. Once the spell is cast, the weather takes 10 minutes to manifest. Ordinarily, a caster can't directly target a creature or object, though indirect effects are possible. This seed can create cold snaps, heat waves, thunderstorms, fogs, blizzards-even a tornado that moves randomly in the affected area. Creating targeted damaging effects requires an additional use of the _energy_ seed.          ",

The _heal_ seed neutralizes poisons in the subject's system so that no additional damage or effects are suffered.

The new form can range in size from Diminutive to one size larger than the subject's normal form. For each additional increment of size change, increase the Spellcraft DC by +6. If the caster wants to transform a nonmagical, inanimate object into a creature of his or her type or transform a creature into a nonmagical, inanimate object, increase the Spellcraft DC by +10. To change a creature of one type into another type increase the Spellcraft DC by +5.      Transformations involving nonmagical, inanimate substances with hardness are more difficult; for each 2 points of hardness, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1.      To transform a creature into an incorporeal or gaseous form, increase the Spellcraft DC by +10. Conversely, to overcome the natural immunity of a gaseous or incorporeal creature to transformation, increase the Spellcraft DC by +10.      The _transform_ seed can also change its target into someone specific. To transform an object or creature into the specific likeness of another individual (including memories and mental abilities), increase the Spellcraft DC by +25. If the transformed creature doesn't have the level or Hit Dice of its new likeness, it can only use the abilities of the creature at its own level or Hit Dice. If slain or destroyed, the transformed creature or object reverts to its original form. The subject's equipment, if any, remains untransformed or melds into the new form's body, at the caster's option. The transformed creature or object acquires the physical and natural abilities of the creature or object it has been changed into while retaining its own memories and mental ability scores. Mental abilities include personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change in its Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus, base saves, extraordinary abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not its supernatural abilities. Physical abilities include natural size and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. Natural abilities include armor, natural weapons, and similar gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth), and possibly hardness. Creatures transformed into inanimate objects do not gain the benefit of their untransformed physical abilities, and may well be blind, deaf, dumb, and unfeeling. Objects transformed into creatures gain that creature's average physical ability scores, but are considered to have mental ability scores of 0 (the _fortify_ seed can add points to each mental ability, if desired). For each normal extraordinary ability or supernatural ability granted to the transformed creature, increase the Spellcraft DC by +10. The transformed subject can have no more Hit Dice than the caster has or than the subject has (whichever is greater). In any case, for each Hit Die the assumed form has above 15, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2.          ",

      "description": "      Spells using the _Transport_ seed instantly take the caster to a designated destination, regardless of distance. For interplanar travel, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. For each additional 50 pounds in objects and willing creatures beyond the base 1,000 pounds, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. The base use of the _Transport_ seed provides instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane. To shift the transportation medium to another medium increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. The caster does not need to make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to him or her. Only objects worn or carried (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance. For a spell intended to transport unwilling creatures, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. The caster must have at least a reliable description of the place to which he or she is transporting. If the caster attempts to use the _Transport_ seed with insufficient or misleading information, the character disappears and simply reappear in his or her original location.      As a special use of the _Transport_ seed, a caster can develop a spell that temporarily transports him or her into a different time stream (leaving the caster in the same physical location); this increases the Spellcraft DC by +8. If the caster moves him or herself, or the subject, into a slower time stream for 5 rounds, time ceases to flow for the subject, and its condition becomes fixed-no force or effect can harm it until the duration expires. If the caster moves him or her self into a faster time stream, the caster speeds up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. The caster is free to act for 5 rounds of apparent time. Fire, cold, poison gas, and similar effects can still harm the caster. While the caster is in the fast time stream, other creatures are invulnerable to his or her attacks and spells; however, the caster can create spell effects and leave them to take effect when he or she reenters normal time. Because of the branching nature of time, epic spells used to transport a subject into a faster time stream cannot be made permanent, nor can the duration of 5 rounds be extended. More simply, the seed can _haste_ or _slow_ a subject for 20 rounds by transporting it to the appropriate time stream. This decreases the Spellcraft DC by -4.          ",

      "description": "      This seed can grant a creature protection from damage of a specified type. The caster can protect a creature from standard damage or from energy damage. The caster can protect a creature or area from magic. Alternatively, he or she can hedge out a type of creature from a specified area. A ward against standard damage protects a creature from whichever two the caster selects of the three damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. For a ward against all three types, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. Each round, the spell created with the _Ward_ seed absorbs the first 5 points of damage the creature would otherwise take, regardless of whether the source of the damage is natural or magical. For each additional point of protection, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2.      A ward against energy grants a creature protection from whichever one the caster selects of the five energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. Each round, the spell absorbs the first 5 points of damage the creature would otherwise take from the specified energy type, regardless of whether the source of damage is natural or magical. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well. For each additional point of protection, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1.      A ward against a specific type of creature prevents bodily contact from whichever one of several monster types the caster selects. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or intentionally moves within 5 feet of the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.      A ward against magic creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere (with radius 10 feet) that surrounds the caster and excludes all spell effects of up to 1st level. Alternatively, the caster can ward just the target and not create the radius effect. For each additional level of spells to be excluded, increase the Spellcraft DC by +20 (but see below). The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the ward, and such spells fail to affect any target within the ward. This includes spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from magic items. However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the ward. The caster can leave and return to the protected area without penalty (unless the spell specifically targets a creature and does not provide a radius effect). The ward could be brought down by a targeted _dispel magic_ spell. Epic spells using the _Dispel_ seed may bring down a ward if the enemy spellcaster succeeds at a caster level check. The ward may also be brought down with a targeted epic spell using the _Destroy_ seed if the enemy spellcaster succeeds at a caster level check.      Instead of creating an epic spell that uses the _Ward_ seed to nullify all spells of a given level and lower, the caster can create a ward that nullifies a specific spell (or specific set of spells). For each specific spell so nullified, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2 per spell level above 1st.          ",

Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it. The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike.

Any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature can make a Will save to recognize its true nature.      Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage from the attack.

      "description": "      To use the _Shadow walk_ spell, you must be in an area of shadowy illumination. You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.      In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.      Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10x100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10x1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).      _Shadow walk_ can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.      Any creatures touched by you when _Shadow walk_ is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.      They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.          ",

You affect a 10-footsquare area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot. Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth or stone creatures are not affected.      A creature in mud must succeed on a Reflex save or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast spells. A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it can't run or charge.      Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed and can't run or charge over the surface.      Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before.      While _soften earth and stone_ does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls.

      "description": "      A weapon made of pure force springs into existence and attacks opponents at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, +1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.      Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the _spiritual weapon_ is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.      A _spiritual weapon_ cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but _dispel magic_, _disintegrate_, a _sphere of annihilation_, or a _rod of cancellation_ affects it. A _spiritual weapon_'s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).      If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the _spiritual weapon_ strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.      The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a _spiritual weapon_ of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each alignment are as follows.      <div topic='Chaos: Battleaxe' level='8'>_Chaos:_ Battleaxe</div>      <div topic='Evil: Light Flail' level='8'>_Evil:_ Light flail</div>      <div topic='Good: Warhammer' level='8'>_Good:_ Warhammer_Law:_ Longsword,</div>    ",

      "description": "      This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a _symbol of death_ slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The _symbol of death_ affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the _symbol_ becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. Any creature that enters the area while the _symbol of death_ is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the _symbol_ only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the _symbol_ is still active, it must save again.      Until it is triggered, the _symbol of death_ is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a _symbol of death_ must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the _symbol of death_ ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the _symbol of death_ works normally.      As a default, a _symbol of death_ is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a _symbol of death_'s triggering conditions cannot be changed.      In this case, 'reading' the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a _symbol of death_ to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a _symbol of death_ offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the _symbol of death_ is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a _symbol of death_ cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.      You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a _symbol of death_ can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.      When scribing a _symbol of death_, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.      You also can attune any number of creatures to the _symbol of death_,  but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer. Any creature attuned to a _symbol of death_ cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own _symbols of death_, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.      _Read magic_ allows you to identify a _symbol of death_ with a DC 19 Spellcraft check. Of course, if the _symbol of death_ is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.      A _symbol of death_ can be removed by a successful _dispel magic_ targeted solely on the rune. An _erase_ spell has no effect on a _symbol of death_. Destruction of the surface where a _symbol of death_ is inscribed destroys the _symbol_ but also triggers it.      _symbol of death_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell. A permanent _symbol of death_ that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.      _Note:_ Magic traps such as _symbol of death_ are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a _symbol of death_ and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for _symbol of death_.          ",

      "description": "      You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.      _Sustained Force:_ A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.      This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.      An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks.      _Combat Maneuver:_ Alternatively, once per round, you can use _telekinesis_ to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn't allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.      _Violent Thrust:_ Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).      You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).      Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).          ",

You can move objects or creatures in the sphere that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds or less by concentrating on the sphere. You can begin moving a sphere in the round after casting the spell. If you concentrate on doing so (a standard action), you can move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round. If you cease concentrating, the sphere does not move in that round (if on a level surface) or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface, or the spell's duration expires, or you begin concentrating again. If you cease concentrating (voluntarily or due to failing a Concentration check), you can resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell's duration.

      "description": "      This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.      You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.      To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.      _Familiarity:_ 'Very familiar' is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. 'Studied carefully' is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you've been there often, or you have used other means (such as _scrying_) to study the place for at least one hour. 'Seen casually' is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. 'Viewed once' is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic.      'False destination' is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.      _On Target:_ You appear where you want to be.      _Off Target:_ You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly      _Similar Area:_ You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area.      Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.      _Mishap:_ You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten 'scrambled.' You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time 'Mishap' comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.      <table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'><tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'><td><b>Familiarity</b><br/></td><td><b>On Target</b><br/></td><td><b>Off Target</b><br/></td><td><b>Similar Area</b><br/></td><td><b>Mishap</b><br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'><td>Very familiar<br/></td><td>01-97<br/></td><td>98-99<br/></td><td>100<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'><td>Studied carefully<br/></td><td>01-94<br/></td><td>95-97<br/></td><td>98-99<br/></td><td>100<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'><td>Seen casually<br/></td><td>01-88<br/></td><td>89-94<br/></td><td>95-98<br/></td><td>99-100<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'><td>Viewed once<br/></td><td>01-76<br/></td><td>77-88<br/></td><td>89-96<br/></td><td>97-100<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'><td>False destination (1d20+80)<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>81-92<br/></td><td>93-100<br/></td></tr></table>          ",

      "description": "      The character snatches him or her self from 1 round in the future, depositing this future self in an adjacent space as a free action that counts as a quickened spell. The character's future self is technically only a possible future self (the time stream is a maelstrom of multiple probabilities), but snatching that future self from 1 round in the future collapses probability, and the possible future becomes the definite future. The character and his or her future self are both free to act normally this round (the character has already used up the limit of one quickened spell per round, but his or her duplicate hasn't). The future self has all the resources the character has at the moment he or she finishes casting _time duplicate_. Because the future self was previously only a possibility, his or her resources are not depleted as a result of whatever might occur this round (even if the character dies this round). Likewise, he or she doesn't have any special knowledge of what might occur during this round. Because the future self is still part of the time stream, the round it spends with the character is a round it misses in its own future. Because the chracter's future duplicate is also the character, the character misses the next round as well. He or she simply isn't there. Tampering with the time stream is a tricky business. Here is a round-by-round summary.      _Round One:_ The character casts _time duplicate_, the future self from round two arrives, and both act normally.      _Round Two:_ The future self-the character-gets snatched back in time to help the past self. During this round, there are no versions of the character present.      _Round Three:_ The character rejoins the time stream. The character arrives in the same location and condition that the future self ended with at the end of the first round. Any resources (spells, damage, staff charges) the future self used up in round one are gone for real. Record them now. Using this spell to snatch a single future self stretches time and probability to its limit; more powerful versions of _time duplicate_ are not possible. A character cannot bring more than a single future version of him or her self back at one time, nor can a character snatch a version of him or her from farther in the future.          ",

The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.      Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways.      _Spell Completion:_ First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows spell resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature's name is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by 2. If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters.      _Trigger Object:_ The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled. A _sympathy_ spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or a save.          ",

      "description": "      _unhallow_ makes a particular site, building, or structure an unholy site. This has three major effects.      First, the site or structure is guarded by a _magic circle against good_ effect.      Second, all turning checks made to turn undead take a -4 penalty, and turning checks to rebuke undead gain a +4 profane bonus. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. (This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell.)      Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the _unhallowed_ site. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of its normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that share your faith or alignment, or creatures that adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting _unhallow_ again.      Spell effects that may be tied to an _unhallowed_ site include _aid_,  _bane_,  _bless_,  _cause fear_,  _darkness_,  _daylight_,  _death ward_,  _deeper darkness_,  _detect magic_,  _detect good_,  _dimensional anchor_,  _discern lies_,  _dispel magic_,  _endure elements_,  _freedom of movement_,  _invisibility purge_,  _protection from energy_,  _remove fear_,  _resist energy_,  _silence_,  _tongues_,  and _zone of truth_.      Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells' effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.)      An area can receive only one _unhallow_ spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time.      _unhallow_ counters but does not dispel _hallow_.          ",

A _wall of ice_ cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a _wall of ice_,  and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a _wall of ice_ creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.      _Ice Plane:_ A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.      Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.      Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save).      _Hemisphere:_ The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The _hemisphere_ is as hard to break through as the _ice plane_ form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.          ",

The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.      Unlike a _wall of iron_,  you can create a _wall of stone_ in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.      Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a _disintegrate_ spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.

Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a _wall of thorns_ takes slashing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an Armor Class of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.)      You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.      Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.      Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a _wall of thorns_ at normal speed without taking damage.      A _wall of thorns_ can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.

      "description": "      _web_ creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a _web_ become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won't cause you to become entangled.      Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled (see below). If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can't move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the _web_ very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.      If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover.      The strands of a _web_ spell are flammable. A magic _flaming sword_ can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.      _web_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell. A permanent _web_ that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.          ",

Two to five _Wish_ spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. _Note:_ An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.</li> <li> Remove injuries and afflictions. A single _Wish_ can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same _wish_. A _Wish_ can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.</li> <li> Revive the dead. A _Wish_ can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a _resurrection_ spell. A _Wish_ can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two _wishes_,  one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A _Wish_ cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level.</li> <li> Transport travelers. A _Wish_ can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.</li> <li> Undo misfortune. A _Wish_ can undo a single recent event. The _Wish_ forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a _Wish_ could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.</li></ul>      You may try to use a _Wish_ to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous.

equals his level plus any Charisma modifier. In order to take into account negative Charisma modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but the character must still be 6th level or higher in order to gain the Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect a character's Leadership score, as detailed above._Cohort Level:_ The character can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of a character's Leadership score, he can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than himself. The cohort should be equipped with gear appropriate for its level. A character can try to attract a cohort of a particular race, class, and alignment. The cohort's alignment may not be opposed to the leader's alignment on either the law-vs-chaos or good-vs-evil axis, and the leader takes a Leadership penalty if he recruits a cohort of an alignment different from his own.Cohorts earn XP as follows:The cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party's XP.Divide the cohort's level by the level of the PC with whom he or she is associated (the character with the Leadership feat who attracted the cohort).Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to the PC and add that number of experience points to the cohort's total.If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than the associated PC's character level, the cohort does not gain the new level-its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed attain the next level._Number of Followers by Level:_ The character can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except they're generally low-level NPCs. Because they're generally five or more levels behind the character they follow, they're rarely effective in combat.Followers don't earn experience and thus don't gain levels. However, when a character with Leadership attains a new level, the player consults the table above to determine if she has acquired more followers, some of which may be higher level than the existing followers. (You don't consult the table to see if your cohort gains levels, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.)</div>",

Like a cleric, an adept must choose and prepare her spells in advance. Unlike a cleric, an adept cannot spontaneously cast _cure_ or _inflict_ spells.To prepare or cast a spell, an adept must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an adept's spell is 10 + the spell level + the adept's Wisdom modifier.Adepts, unlike wizards, do not acquire their spells from books or scrolls, nor do they prepare them through study. Instead, they meditate or pray for their spells, receiving them as divine inspiration or through their own strength of faith. Each adept must choose a time each day at which she must spend an hour in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether an adept can prepare spells.Like other spellcasters, an adept can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Adept. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score.When Table: The Adept indicates that the adept gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level.Each adept has a particular holy symbol (as a divine focus) depending on the adept's magical tradition.</div><div topic='Summon Familiar' level='8'><b>Summon Familiar:</b> At 2nd level, an adept can call a familiar, just as a sorcerer or wizard can.</div></div><div topic='Adept Spell List' level='5'><h5><b>Adept Spell List</b></h5>Adepts choose their spells from the following list.0 Level: _create water_,  _cure minor wounds_,  _detect magic_,  _ghost sound_,  _guidance_,  _light_,  _mending_,  _purify food and drink_,  _read magic_,  _touch of fatigue_.1st Level: _bless_,  _burning hands_,  _cause fear_,  _command_,  _comprehend languages_,  _cure light wounds_,  _detect chaos_,  _detect evil_,  _detect good_,  _detect law_,  _endure elements_,  _obscuring mist_,  _protection from chaos_,  _protection from evil_,  _protection from good_,  _protection from law_,  _sleep_.2nd Level: _aid_,  _animal trance_,  _bear's endurance_,  _bull's strength_,  _cat's grace_,  _cure moderate wounds_,  _darkness_,  _delay poison_,  _invisibility_,  _mirror image_,  _resist energy_,  _scorching ray_,  _see invisibility_,  _web_.3rd Level: _animate dead_,  _bestow curse_,  _contagion_,  _continual flame_,  _cure serious wounds_,  _daylight_,  _deeper darkness_,  _lightning bolt_,  _neutralize poison_,  _remove curse_,  _remove disease_,  _tongues_.4th Level: _cure critical wounds_,  _minor creation_,  _polymorph_,  _restoration_,  _stoneskin_,  _wall of fire_.5th Level: _baleful polymorph_,  _break enchantment_,  _commune_,  _heal_,  _major creation_,  _raise dead_,  _true seeing_,  _wall of stone_.</div></div>    ",

If already an epic spellcaster, the character gains only the benefit noted under the Spells entry for that epic class. He or she does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an agent retriever, the player must decide to which class to add the new level for the purpose of determining spells per day.</div><div topic='Uncanny Location' level='8'><b>_uncanny location_ (Sp):</b> When a agent retriever spends one day attuning him or herself to a person or object he or she is seeking, he or she automatically determines that person's or item's location as the _discern location_ spell. Once he or she has established a sense of the location, the agent retriever can maintain this uncanny link even if the target moves, but only so long as he or she hunts down this person or item to the exclusion of all other pursuits. If he or she ever turns aside to undertake a second pursuit, the _uncanny location_ ends, and the agent retriever must spend another day to reattune him or herself to the target.</div><div topic='Tracking Bonus' level='8'><b>Tracking Bonus (Ex):</b> The agent retriever gains a +10 insight bonus on Wilderness Lore checks to track the quarry.

The agent retriever can attempt to enclose any creature or object he or she can see within 30 feet. The target is allowed a Reflex saving throw (DC 20 + 1/2 the class level of the agent retriever + the agent retriever's Dexterity modifier). Those who fail are then encapsulated in a sphere of force with a radius of up to 50 feet (the sphere is only as large as it needs to be, up to its maximum radius). Those trapped inside cannot escape except with methods that can bypass or destroy a _wall of force_. The sphere persists as long as the agent retriever desires, up to a maximum of seven days. A captured target does not count toward the capacity of the agent retriever's _Plane Shift_ ability, and the agent retriever can plane shift with the target despite the presence of the _force sphere_. The agent retriever can use this power once per day at 3rd level, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter.</div><div topic='Ethereal Jaunt' level='8'><b>_Ethereal Jaunt_ (Sp):</b> The agent retriever can use _Ethereal Jaunt_ as a 14th-level caster once per day at 4th level, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter.</div><div topic='Bonus Feats' level='8'><b>Bonus Feats:</b> The agent retriever gets a bonus feat at 5th level and an additional bonus feat every five levels thereafter.

Unlike magic weapons created by normal means, the archer need not spend experience points or gold pieces to accomplish this task. However, an archer's magic arrows only function for her. For every two levels the character advances past 1st level in the prestige class, the magic arrows she creates gain +1 greater potency (+1 at 1st level, +2 at 3rd level, +3 at 5th level, +4 at 7th level, and +5 at 9th level).</div><div topic='Imbue Arrow' level='8'><b>_Imbue Arrow_ (Sp):</b> At 2nd level, an arcane archer gains the ability to place an area spell upon an arrow. When the arrow is fired, the spell's area is centered on where the arrow lands, even if the spell could normally be centered only on the caster. This ability allows the archer to use the bow's range rather than the spell's range. It takes a standard action to cast the spell and fire the arrow. The arrow must be fired in the round the spell is cast, or the spell is wasted.</div><div topic='Seeker Arrow' level='8'><b>_Seeker Arrow_ (Sp):</b> At 4th level, an arcane archer can launch an arrow once per day at a target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target, even around corners. Only an unavoidable obstacle or the limit of the arrow's range prevents the arrow's flight. This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action).</div><div topic='Phase Arrow' level='8'><b>_Phase Arrow_ (Sp):</b> At 6th level, an arcane archer can launch an arrow once per day at a target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target in a straight path, passing through any nonmagical barrier or wall in its way. (Any magical barrier stops the arrow.) This ability negates cover, concealment, and even armor modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally.Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action).</div><div topic='Hail of Arrows' level='8'><b>_Hail of Arrows_ (Sp):</b> In lieu of her regular attacks, once per day an arcane archer of 8th level or higher can fire an arrow at each and every target within range, to a maximum of one target for every arcane archer level she has earned. Each attack uses the archer's primary attack bonus, and each enemy may only be targeted by a single arrow.</div><div topic='Arrow of Death' level='8'><b>_arrow of death_ (Sp):</b> At 10th level, an arcane archer can create an _arrow of death_ that forces the target, if damaged by the arrow's attack, to make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be slain immediately. It takes one day to make an _arrow of death_, and the arrow only functions for the arcane archer who created it. The _arrow of death_ lasts no longer than one year, and the archer can only have one such arrow in existence at a time.</div></div></div>    ",

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class in which he could cast 7th-level spells before he became an archmage, he must decide to which class he adds each level of archmage for the purpose of determining spells per day.</div><div topic='High Arcana' level='8'><b>High Arcana:</b> An archmage gains the opportunity to select a special ability from among those described below by permanently eliminating one existing spell slot (she cannot eliminate a spell slot of higher level than the highest-level spell she can cast). Each special ability has a minimum required spell slot level, as specified in its description.An archmage may choose to eliminate a spell slot of a higher level than that required to gain a type of high arcana._Arcane Fire (Su):_ The archmage gains the ability to change arcane spell energy into arcane fire, manifesting it as a bolt of raw magical energy. The bolt is a ranged touch attack with long range (400 feet + 40 feet/level of archmage) that deals 1d6 points of damage per class level of the archmage plus 1d6 points of damage per level of the spell used to create the effect. This ability costs one 9th-level spell slot._Arcane Reach (Su):_ The archmage can use spells with a range of touch on a target up to 30 feet away. The archmage must make a ranged touch attack. Arcane reach can be selected a second time as a special ability, in which case the range increases to 60 feet. This ability costs one 7th-level spell slot._Mastery of Counterspelling:_ When the archmage counterspells a spell, it is turned back upon the caster as if it were fully affected by a _spell turning_ spell. If the spell cannot be affected by _spell turning_, then it is merely counterspelled. This ability costs one 7th-level spell slot._Mastery of Elements:_ The archmage can alter an arcane spell when cast so that it utilizes a different element from the one it normally uses. This ability can only alter a spell with the acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic descriptor. The spell's casting time is unaffected. The caster decides whether to alter the spell's energy type and chooses the new energy type when he begins casting. This ability costs one 8th-level spell slot._Mastery of Shaping:_ The archmage can alter area and effect spells that use one of the following shapes: burst, cone, cylinder, emanation, or spread. The alteration consists of creating spaces within the spell's area or effect that are not subject to the spell. The minimum dimension for these spaces is a 5-foot cube. Furthermore, any shapeable spells have a minimum dimension of 5 feet instead of 10 feet. This ability costs one 6th-level spell slot._Spell Power:_ This ability increases the archmage's effective caster level by +1 (for purposes of determining level-dependent spell variables such as damage dice or range, and caster level checks only). This ability costs one 5th-level spell slot._Spell-Like Ability:_ An archmage who selects this type of high arcana can use one of her arcane spell slots (other than a slot expended to learn this or any other type of high arcana) to permanently prepare one of her arcane spells as a spell-like ability that can be used twice per day. The archmage does not use any components when casting the spell, although a spell that costs XP to cast still does so and a spell with a costly material component instead costs her 10 times that amount in XP. This ability costs one 5th-level spell slot.The spell-like ability normally uses a spell slot of the spell's level, although the archmage can choose to make a spell modified by a metamagic feat into a spell-like ability at the appropriate spell level.The archmage may use an available higher-level spell slot in order to use the spell-like ability more often. Using a slot three levels higher than the chosen spell allows her to use the spell-like ability four times per day, and a slot six levels higher lets her use it six times per day.If spell-like ability is selected more than one time as a high arcana choice, this ability can apply to the same spell chosen the first time (increasing the number of times per day it can be used) or to a different spell.</div></div></div>    ",

While studying the victim, the assassin can undertake other actions so long as his attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the assassin or recognize the assassin as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the assassin's class level + the assassin's Int modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the assassin. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the assassin has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds.If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her save) or if the assassin does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another death attack.</div><div topic='Poison Use' level='8'><b>Poison Use:</b> Assassins are trained in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when applying poison to a blade.</div><div topic='Spells' level='8'><b>Spells:</b> Beginning at 1st level, an assassin gains the ability to cast a number of arcane spells. To cast a spell, an assassin must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an assassin with an Intelligence of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Assassin bonus spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the assassin's Intelligence bonus. When the assassin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Intelligence score for that spell level.The assassin's spell list appears below. An assassin casts spells just as a bard does.Upon reaching 6th level, at every even-numbered level after that (8th and 10th), an assassin can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level assassin spell the assassin can cast. An assassin may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for that level.<table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'><tr maxcol='6' curcol='2'><td colspan='5'><b>Table: Assassin Spells Known</b><br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='3'><td/><td colspan='4' align='center'><b>-- Spells Known --</b><br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'><td><b>Level</b><br/></td><td><b>1st</b><br/></td><td><b>2nd</b><br/></td><td><b>3rd</b><br/></td><td><b>4th</b><br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'><td>1st<br/></td><td>2<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'><td>2nd<br/></td><td>3<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'><td>3rd<br/></td><td>3<br/></td><td>2<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'><td>4th<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>3<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'><td>5th<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>3<br/></td><td>2<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'><td>6th<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>3<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'><td>7th<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>3<br/></td><td>2<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'><td>8th<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>3<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'><td>9th<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>3<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'><td>10th<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>4<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='6' curcol='2'><td colspan='5'>1 Provided the assassin has sufficient Intelligence to have a bonus spell of this level.<br/></td></tr></table></div><div topic='Save Bonus Against Poison' level='8'><b>Save Bonus against Poison:</b> The assassin gains a natural saving throw bonus to all poisons gained at 2nd level that increases by +1 for every two additional levels the assassin gains.</div><div topic='Uncanny Dodge' level='8'><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> Starting at 2nd level, an assassin retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker.

This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the assassin. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the assassin can flank him (and thus sneak attack him).If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</div><div topic='Hide in Plain Sight' level='8'><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Su):</b> At 8th level, an assassin can use the Hide skill even while being observed.

This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn.</div><div topic='Illiteracy' level='8'><b>Illiteracy:</b> Barbarians are the only characters who do not automatically know how to read and write. A barbarian may spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages he is able to speak.A barbarian who gains a level in any other class automatically gains literacy. Any other character who gains a barbarian level does not lose the literacy he or she already had.</div><div topic='Rage' level='8'><b>Rage (Ex):</b> A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in Constitution increases the barbarian's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can't charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies; see below).A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use his rage ability once per day. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six times per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his action, not in response to someone else's action.</div><div topic='Uncanny Dodge' level='8'><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, a barbarian retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</div><div topic='Trap Sense' level='8'><b>Trap Sense (Ex):</b> Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</div><div topic='Improved Uncanny Dodge' level='8'><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank the character.</div><div topic='Damage Reduction' level='8'><b>Damage Reduction (Ex):</b> At 7th level, a barbarian gains Damage Reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</div><div topic='Greater Rage' level='8'><b>Greater Rage (Ex):</b> At 11th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at -2.</div><div topic='Indomitable Will' level='8'><b>Indomitable Will (Ex):</b> While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage.</div><div topic='Tireless Rage' level='8'><b>Tireless Rage (Ex):</b> At 17th level and higher, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.</div><div topic='Mighty Rage' level='8'><b>Mighty Rage (Ex):</b> At 20th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at -2.</div></div><div topic='Ex-Barbarians' level='5'><h5><b>Ex-Barbarians</b></h5>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian.

class features of the bard.<div topic='Weapon and Armor Proficiency' level='8'><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> A bard is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Bards are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields). A bard can cast bard spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do). A multiclass bard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.</div><div topic='Spells' level='8'><b>Spells:</b> A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing, reciting, or music). To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard's spell is 10 + the spell level + the bard's Charisma modifier.Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Bard. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score. When Table: Bard Spells Known indicates that the bard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.The bard's selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells of your choice. At most new bard levels, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Bard Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Bard Spells Known are fixed.)Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard 'loses' the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard can cast. A bard may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.As noted above, a bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.</div><div topic='Bardic Knowledge' level='8'><b>Bardic Knowledge:</b> A bard may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to his bard level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If the bard has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check.)A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general function. A bard may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random.<table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td><b>DC</b><br/></td><td><b>Type of Knowledge</b><br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>10<br/></td><td>Common, known by at least a substantial minority drinking; common legends of the local population.<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>20<br/></td><td>Uncommon but available, known by only a few people legends.<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>25<br/></td><td>Obscure, known by few, hard to come by.<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>30<br/></td><td>Extremely obscure, known by very few, possibly forgotten by most who once knew it, possibly known only by those who don't understand the significance of the knowledge.<br/></td></tr></table></div><div topic='Bardic Music' level='8'><b>Bardic Music:</b> Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if desired). While these abilities fall under the category of bardic music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrical songs, singing melodies, whistling, playing an instrument, or playing an instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to qualify; if a bard does not have the required number of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the needed ranks.Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using bardic music that doesn't require concentration, a bard cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands). Just as for casting a spell with a verbal component, a deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the attempt still counts against his daily limit._Countersong (Su):_ A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components). Each round of the countersong, he makes a Perform check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself ) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard's Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard's Perform check result for the save. Countersong has no effect against effects that don't allow saves. The bard may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds._Fascinate (Sp):_ A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability.To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each affected creature's Will save against the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round per bard level). While fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result.Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. _fascinate_ is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability._Inspire Courage (Su):_ A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage in his allies (including himself ), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th). Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability._Inspire Competence (Su):_ A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The bard must also be able to see the ally.The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he or she continues to hear the bard's music. Certain uses of this ability are infeasible. The effect lasts as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard can't inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence is a mind-affecting ability._Suggestion (Sp):_ A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make a _Suggestion_ (as the spell) to a creature that he has already fascinated (see above). Using this ability does not break the bard's concentration on the _fascinate_ effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw against the _fascinate_ effect.Making a _Suggestion_ doesn't count against a bard's daily limit on bardic music performances. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard's level + bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature (but see _mass suggestion_, below). _Suggestion_ is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent ability._Inspire Greatness (Su):_ A bard of 9th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally with a single use of this ability (two at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th). To inspire greatness, a bard must sing and an ally must hear him sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target's Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependant. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability._Song of Freedom (Sp):_ A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to create an effect equivalent to the _break enchantment_ spell (caster level equals the character's bard level). Using this ability requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration and music, and it functions on a single target within 30 feet. A bard can't use _song of freedom_ on himself._Inspire Heroics (Su):_ A bard of 15th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear the bard sing for a full round. A creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability._Mass Suggestion (Sp):_ This ability functions like _suggestion_,  above, except that a bard of 18th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make the _Suggestion_ simultaneously to any number of creatures that he has already fascinated (see above). _Mass suggestion_ is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.</div></div><div topic='Ex-Bards' level='5'><h5><b>Ex-Bards</b></h5>A bard who becomes lawful in alignment cannot progress in levels as a bard, though he retains all his bard abilities.</div></div>    ",

Features of the blackguard prestige class.<div topic='Weapon and Armor Proficiency' level='8'><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Blackguards are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields.</div><div topic='Aura of Evil' level='8'><b>Aura of Evil (Ex):</b> The power of a blackguard's aura of evil (see the _detect evil_ spell) is equal to his class level plus his cleric level, if any.</div><div topic='Detect Good' level='8'><b>_Detect Good_ (Sp):</b> At will, a blackguard can use _Detect Good_ as a spell-like ability, duplicating the effect of the _Detect Good_ spell.</div><div topic='Poison Use' level='8'><b>Poison Use:</b> Blackguards are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when applying poison to a blade.</div><div topic='Dark Blessing' level='8'><b>Dark Blessing (Su):</b> A blackguard applies his Charisma modifier (if positive) as a bonus on all saving throws.</div><div topic='Spells' level='8'><b>Spells:</b> A blackguard has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a blackguard spell, a blackguard must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a blackguard with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells.Blackguard bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the blackguard's Wisdom modifier. When the blackguard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The blackguard's spell list appears below. A blackguard has access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare, just as a cleric. A blackguard prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a blackguard cannot spontaneously cast _cure_ or _inflict_ spells).</div><div topic='Smite Good' level='8'><b>Smite Good (Su):</b> Once a day, a blackguard of 2nd level or higher may attempt to smite good with one normal melee attack.He adds his Charisma modifier (if positive) to his attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per class level.

He commands undead as would a cleric of two levels lower.</div><div topic='Sneak Attack' level='8'><b>Sneak Attack:</b> This ability, gained at 4th level, is like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage increases by +1d6 every third level beyond 4th (7th and 10th). If a blackguard gets a sneak attack bonus from another source the bonuses on damage stack.</div></div><div topic='Blackguard Spell List' level='5'><h5><b>Blackguard Spell List</b></h5>Blackguards choose their spells from the following list:1st Level: _cause fear_,  _corrupt weapon_,  _cure light wounds_,  _doom_,  _inflict light wounds_,  _magic weapon_,  _summon monster I*_.2nd Level: _bull's strength_,  _cure moderate wounds_,  _darkness_,  _death knell_,  _eagle's splendor_,  _inflict moderate wounds_,  _shatter_,  _summon monster II*_.3rd Level: _contagion_,  _cure serious wounds_,  _deeper darkness_,  _inflict serious wounds_,  _protection from energy_,  _summon monster III*_.4th Level: _cure critical wounds_,  _freedom of movement_,  _inflict critical wounds_,  _poison_,  _summon monster IV*_.* Evil creatures only.</div><div topic='Corrupt Weapon' level='5'><h5><b>Corrupt Weapon</b></h5>Blackguards have access to a special spell, _corrupt weapon_,  which is the opposing counterpart of the paladin spell _bless weapon_. Instead of improving a weapon's effectiveness against evil foes _corrupt weapon_ makes a weapon more effective against good foes.</div><div topic='Fallen Paladins' level='5'><h5><b>Fallen Paladins</b></h5>Blackguards who have levels in the paladin class (that is to say, are now ex-paladins) gain extra abilities the more levels of paladin they have.A fallen paladin who becomes a blackguard gains all of the following abilities that apply, according to the number of paladin levels the character has.1-2: Smite good 1/day. (This is in addition to the ability granted to all blackguards at 2nd level.3-4: Lay on hands. Once per day, the blackguard can use this supernatural ability to cure himself or his fiendish servant of damage equal to his Charisma bonus x his level.5-6: Sneak attack damage increased by +1d6. Smite good 2/day.7-8: Fiendish summoning. Once per day, the blackguard can use a _summon monster I_ spell to call forth an evil creature. For this spell, the caster level is double the blackguard's class level.9-10: Undead companion. In addition to the fiendish servant, the blackguard gains (at 5th level) a Medium-size skeleton or zombie as a companion. This companion cannot be turned or rebuked and gains all special bonuses as a fiendish servant when the blackguard gains levels. Smite good 3/day.11 or more: A fallen paladin of this stature immediately gains a blackguard level for each level of paladin he trades in.The character level of the character does not change. With the loss of paladin levels, the character no longer gains as many extra abilities for being a fallen paladin.</div><div topic='Blackguard's Fiendish Servant' level='5'><h5><b>The Blackguard's Fiendish Servant</b></h5>Upon or after reaching 5th level, a blackguard can call a fiendish bat, cat, dire rat, horse, pony, raven, or toad to serve him.

Improved evasion is an extraordinary ability.</div><div topic='Share Saving Throws' level='8'><b>Share Saving Throws:</b> For each of its saving throws, the servant uses either its own base save bonus or the blackguard's, whichever is higher. The servant applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any other bonuses on saves that the blackguard might have.</div><div topic='Share Spells' level='8'><b>Share Spells:</b> At the blackguard's option, he may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also affect his servant. The servant must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the servant if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the servant again even if the servant returns to the blackguard before the duration expires.

He also receives the appropriate Martial Weapon Proficiency feat as a bonus feat, if the weapon falls into that category.</div><div topic='Aura' level='8'><b>Aura (Ex):</b> A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's alignment (see the _detect evil_ spell for details). Clerics who don't worship a specific deity but choose the Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful domain have a similarly powerful aura of the corresponding alignment.</div><div topic='Spells' level='8'><b>Spells:</b> A cleric casts divine spells, which are drawn from the cleric spell list. However, his alignment may restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A cleric must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cleric's spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Cleric. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. A cleric also gets one domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level. When a cleric prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his two domains (see Deities, Domains, and Domain Spells, below).Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a cleric can prepare spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</div><div topic='Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells' level='8'><b>Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells:</b> A cleric's deity influences his alignment, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him. A cleric chooses two domains from among those belonging to his deity. A cleric can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain.If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two domains to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.Each domain gives the cleric access to a domain spell at each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up, as well as a granted power. The cleric gets the granted powers of both the domains selected.With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a cleric prepares one or the other each day in his domain spell slot. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in his domain spell slot.</div><div topic='Spontaneous Casting' level='8'><b>Spontaneous Casting:</b> A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the cleric did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can 'lose' any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any _cure_ spell of the same spell level or lower (a _cure_ spell is any spell with 'cure' in its name).An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity), can't convert prepared spells to _cure_ spells but can convert them to _inflict_ spells (an _inflict_ spell is one with 'inflict' in its name).A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either _cure_ spells or _inflict_ spells (player's choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric turns or commands undead (see below).</div><div topic='Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells' level='8'><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells:</b> A cleric can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or his deity's (if he has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</div><div topic='Turn or Rebuke Undead' level='8'><b>Turn or Rebuke Undead (Su):</b> Any cleric, regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol (see Turn or Rebuke Undead).A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) can turn or destroy undead creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity must choose whether his turning ability functions as that of a good cleric or an evil cleric. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous _cure_ or _inflict_ spells (see above).A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A cleric with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.</div><div topic='Bonus Languages' level='8'><b>Bonus Languages:</b> A cleric's bonus language options include Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil outsiders, respectively). These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.</div></div><div topic='Ex-Clerics' level='5'><h5><b>Ex-Clerics</b></h5>A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his god loses all spells and class features, except for armor and shield proficiencies and proficiency with simple weapons.

topic='Class Features' level='5'><h5><b>Class Features</b></h5>All of the following are class features of the druid.<div topic='Weapon and Armor Proficiency' level='8'><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. (A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the _ironwood_ spell so that it functions as though it were steel. See the _ironwood_ spell description) Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</div><div topic='Spells' level='8'><b>Spells:</b> A druid casts divine spells, which are drawn from the druid spell list. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance (see below).To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score. She does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.A druid prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a _cure_ spell in its place (but see Spontaneous Casting, below). A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</div><div topic='Spontaneous Casting' level='8'><b>Spontaneous Casting:</b> A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can 'lose' a prepared spell in order to cast any _summon nature's ally_ spell of the same level or lower. <b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells:</b> A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</div><div topic='Bonus Languages' level='8'><b>Bonus Languages:</b> A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.Druidic has its own alphabet.</div><div topic='Animal Companion' level='8'><b>Animal Companion (Ex):</b> A druid may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures are also available: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its kind.A 1st-level druid's companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted below. As a druid advances in level, the animal's power increases as shown on the table. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals (see below). Should she select an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character's druid level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the character's druid level and compare the result with the druid level entry on the table to determine the animal companion's powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the druid's effective level to 0 or lower, she can't have that animal as a companion.)</div><div topic='Nature Sense' level='8'><b>Nature Sense (Ex):</b> A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</div><div topic='Wild Empathy' level='8'><b>Wild Empathy (Ex):</b> A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</div><div topic='Woodland Stride' level='8'><b>Woodland Stride (Ex):</b> Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.</div><div topic='Trackless Step' level='8'><b>Trackless Step (Ex):</b> Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</div><div topic='Resist Nature's Lure' level='8'><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex):</b> Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.</div><div topic='Wild Shape' level='8'><b>Wild Shape (Su):</b> At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the _polymorph_ spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level, as noted on Table: The Druid. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal at 11th level, and a Huge animal at 15th level.The new form's Hit Dice can't exceed the character's druid level.At 12th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a plant creature with the same size restrictions as for animal forms. (A druid can't use this ability to take the form of a plant that isn't a creature.)At 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) once per day. These elemental forms are in addition to her normal wild shape usage. In addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains all the elemental's extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. She also gains the elemental's feats for as long as she maintains the wild shape, but she retains her own creature type.At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level she can do so three times per day. At 20th level, a druid may use this wild shape ability to change into a Huge elemental.</div><div topic='Venom Immunity' level='8'><b>Venom Immunity (Ex):</b> At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</div><div topic='Thousand Faces' level='8'><b>A Thousand Faces (Su):</b> At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the _alter self_ spell, but only while in her normal form.</div><div topic='Timeless Body' level='8'><b>Timeless Body (Ex):</b> After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place.Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.</div></div><div topic='Ex-Druids' level='5'><h5><b>Ex-Druids</b></h5>A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the _atonement_ spell description).</div><div topic='Druid's Animal Companion' level='3'>*The Druid's Animal Companion*A druid's animal companion is different from a normal animal of its kind in many ways.

The druid's class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are entitled to an animal companion for the purpose of determining the companion's abilities and the alternative lists available to the character._Bonus HD:_ Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Remember that extra Hit Dice improve the animal companion's base attack and base save bonuses. An animal companion's base attack bonus is the same as that of a druid of a level equal to the animal's HD. An animal companion has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal's HD). An animal companion gains additional skill points and feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster's Hit Dice._Natural Armor Adj.:_ The number noted here is an improvement to the animal companion's existing natural armor bonus._Str/Dex Adj.:_ Add this value to the animal companion's Strength and Dexterity scores._Bonus Tricks:_ The value given in this column is the total number of 'bonus' tricks that the animal knows in addition to any that the druid might choose to teach it (see the Handle Animal skill). These bonus tricks don't require any training time or Handle Animal checks, and they don't count against the normal limit of tricks known by the animal. The druid selects these bonus tricks, and once selected, they can't be changed._Link (Ex):_ A druid can handle her animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if she doesn't have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. The druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion._Share Spells (Ex):_ At the druid's option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts upon herself also affect her animal companion. The animal companion must be within 5 feet of her at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the animal companion if the companion moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the animal again, even if it returns to the druid before the duration expires.Additionally, the druid may cast a spell with a target of 'You' on her animal companion (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A druid and her animal companion can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion's type (animal)._Evasion (Ex):_ If an animal companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw._Devotion (Ex):_ An animal companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects._Multiattack:_ An animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more natural attacks, the animal companion instead gains a second attack with its primary natural weapon, albeit at a -5 penalty._Improved Evasion (Ex):_ When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, an animal companion takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the saving throw fails.</div></div><div topic='Alternative Animal Companions' level='3'>*Alternative Animal Companions*A druid of sufficiently high level can select her animal companion from one of the following lists, applying the indicated adjustment to the druid's level (in parentheses) for purposes of determining the companion's characteristics and special abilities.<div topic='4th Level or Higher' level='8'><b>4th Level or Higher (Level -3)</b></div><div topic='Ape' level='8'>Ape (animal)Bear, black (animal)</div><div topic='Bison' level='8'>Bison (animal)</div><div topic='Boar' level='8'>Boar (animal)</div><div topic='Cheetah' level='8'>Cheetah (animal)Crocodile (animal)<b>1</b>Dire badgerDire batDire weasel</div><div topic='Leopard' level='8'>Leopard (animal)Lizard, monitor (animal)Shark, Large<b>1</b> (animal)Snake, constrictor (animal)</div><div topic='Snake, Large Viper' level='8'>Snake, Large viper (animal)</div><div topic='Wolverine' level='8'>Wolverine (animal)</div><div topic='7th Level or Higher' level='8'><b>7th Level or Higher (Level -6)</b>Bear, brown (animal)Dire wolverineCrocodile, giant (animal)</div><div topic='Deinonychus' level='8'>Deinonychus (dinosaur)Dire apeDire boarDire wolfElasmosaurus<b>1</b> (dinosaur)</div><div topic='Lion' level='8'>Lion (animal)</div><div topic='Rhinoceros' level='8'>Rhinoceros (animal)</div><div topic='Snake, Huge Viper' level='8'>Snake, Huge viper (animal)</div><div topic='Tiger' level='8'>Tiger (animal)</div><div topic='10th Level or Higher' level='8'><b>10th Level or Higher (Level -9)</b>Bear, polar (animal)Dire lion</div><div topic='Megaraptor' level='8'>Megaraptor (dinosaur)Shark, Huge<b>1</b> (animal)Snake, giant constrictor (animal)Whale, orca<b>1</b> (animal)</div><div topic='13th Level or Higher' level='8'><b>13th Level or Higher (Level -12)</b>Dire bear</div><div topic='Elephant' level='8'>Elephant (animal)Octopus, giant<b>1</b> (animal)</div><div topic='16th Level or Higher' level='8'><b>16th Level or Higher (Level -15)</b>Dire shark<b>1</b> Dire tigerSquid, giant<b>1</b> (animal)</div><div topic='Triceratops' level='8'>Triceratops (dinosaur)</div><div topic='Tyrannosaurus' level='8'>Tyrannosaurus (dinosaur)1 Available only in an aquatic environment.</div></div></div>    ",

He gains +2 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 resistance bonus on all saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The increase in Constitution increases the defender's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance when the Constitution score drops back 4 points. These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are. While in a defensive stance, a defender cannot use skills or abilities that would require him to shift his position. A defensive stance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A defender may end his defensive stance voluntarily prior to this limit. At the end of the defensive stance, the defender is winded and takes a -2 penalty to Strength for the duration of that encounter. A defender can only use his defensive stance a certain number of times per day as determined by his level (see Table: The Dwarven Defender). Using the defensive stance takes no time itself, but a defender can only do so during his action.</div><div topic='Uncanny Dodge' level='8'><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> Starting at 2nd level, a dwarven defender retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (He still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)If a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).</div><div topic='Trap Sense' level='8'><b>Trap Sense (Ex):</b> At 4th level, a dwarven defender gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 8th level, these bonuses rise to +2. These bonuses stack with trap sense bonuses gained from other classes.</div><div topic='Damage Reduction' level='8'><b>Damage Reduction (Ex):</b> At 6th level, a dwarven defender gains damage reduction. Subtract 3 points from the damage the dwarven defender takes each time he is dealt damage. At 10th level, this damage reduction rises to 6/-. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</div><div topic='Improved Uncanny Dodge' level='8'><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> At 6th level, a dwarven defender can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the dwarven defender.The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the dwarven defender can flank him (and thus sneak attack him).If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</div><div topic='Mobile Defense' level='8'><b>Mobile Defense (Ex):</b> At 8th level, a dwarven defender can adjust his position while maintaining a defensive stance. While in a defensive stance, he can take one 5-foot step each round without losing the benefit of the stance.</div></div></div>    ",

However, at distances higher than 1 foot above any surface, her speed diminishes to 10 feet per round.While she remains within 1 foot of a surface, she can make melee and ranged attacks normally, but if she moves any higher, she incurs the penalties on melee and ranged attack rolls as if she were the subject of the _psionic levitate_ power.</div><div topic='Sidestep Charge' level='8'><b>Sidestep Charge (Ex):</b> At 1st level, an elocater gains Sidestep Charge as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. If the character already has this feat, she gains no benefit.</div><div topic='Opportunistic Strike' level='8'><b>Opportunistic Strike (Ex):</b> Beginning at 2nd level, an elocater's hyperawareness of spatial relations gives her an instinctive view of the battlefield, which allows her to make a cunning attack against distracted opponents. The elocater gains a +2 insight bonus on her attack roll and her damage roll (if the attack hits) for the first attack she makes against an opponent that has been dealt damage in melee by another character since the elocater's last action. At 5th level the insight bonus increases to +4, and at 8th level the insight bonus increases to +6.</div><div topic='Dimension Step' level='8'><b>Dimension Step (Su):</b> An elocater of 3rd level or higher can slip psionically between spaces as if using the _psionic dimension door_ power, once per day. The elocater cannot bring any other creatures with her. Her manifester level for this effect is equal to her elocater level.</div><div topic='Flanker' level='8'><b>Flanker (Ex):</b> An elocater of 4th level or higher can flank enemies from seemingly impossible angles. She can designate any adjacent square as the square from which flanking against an ally is determined (including the square where she stands, as normal). She can designate the square at the beginning of her turn or at any time during her turn. The designated square remains her effective square for flanking until she is no longer adjacent to it or until she chooses a different square (at the start of one of her turns). The character can even choose a square that is impassable or occupied.</div><div topic='Transporter' level='8'><b>Transporter (Ex):</b> At 6th level, an elocater learns both _psionic teleport_ and _psionic plane shift_. These powers are in addition to any powers the elocater normally learns by advancing a level.The elocater treats these powers as if they were 3rd-level powers on her class list. This means, among other things, that manifesting these powers costs 5 power points. (If the character does not have a high enough manifester level to manifest 3rd-level powers the character cannot manifest these powers until she has attained the required manifester level.)</div><div topic='Capricious Step' level='8'><b>Capricious Step (Ex):</b> At 7th level, an elocater can take an extra 5-foot step in any round when she doesn't perform any other movement (except for the first 5-foot step). Like the first, the second 5-foot step does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The character can take the extra 5-foot step immediately after taking the first, or wait until the end of her other actions for the round. In all other ways, the rules for taking a 5-foot step apply.</div><div topic='Dimension Spring Attack' level='8'><b>Dimension Spring Attack (Su):</b> An elocater of 9th level or higher can use her dimension step ability in conjunction with her Spring Attack feat once per day. This ability can be used only against opponents within 60 feet to which the elocater has line of sight. She can dimension step up to the target, use Spring Attack, and then use dimension step to return to her starting point. (When she uses this ability, the total distance she can travel before and after the attack is not limited by her speed.) The use of this ability counts as her use of the dimension step ability on that day (and this ability is not available during a day when she has already used dimension step).</div><div topic='Accelerated Action' level='8'><b>Accelerated Action (Su):</b> When she attains 10th level, an elocater can accelerate herself and thereby take more actions than normal. An elocater can accelerate herself for a total of 5 rounds per day. She can choose to parcel out her accelerated actions in 1-round increments. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects that provide additional actions, such as _schism_ or a _haste_ spell-and in fact an elocater can't take an accelerated action if affected by these or similar effects.)If she makes a full attack while accelerated, an elocater can make one extra attack with any weapon she is holding. The attack is made using her full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. If the elocater uses her accelerated action to move, she gains an enhancement bonus to her speed of +30 feet. The elocater can use her accelerated action to manifest a power, as long as she has not already manifested a power in the current round and the one she wants to manifest has a manifesting time of 1 standard action or shorter. While accelerated, she gains a +2 dodge bonus on attack rolls and Reflex saves and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class. Any condition that makes her lose her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes her lose these dodge bonuses.</div></div></div>    ",

While operating in a cover identity, the epic infiltra-tor gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Gather Information checks. When the epic infiltrator has the option of adding a new cover identity, he or she may instead work on further perfecting a cover identity already possessed. An improved cover identity grants a +6 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Gather Information checks while operating in that identity. A specific cover identity may be improved multiple times, each time adding +2 to the bonuses. It is impossible to detect the epic infiltrator's alignment with any form of divination. This ability functions exactly like an _undetectable alignment_ spell, except that it is always active as a supernatural ability. Only divinations are confounded; spells that function only against certain alignments affect the epic infiltrator normally. Should the epic infiltrator wish to 'retire' a cover identity and develop a new one, he or she must spend one week practicing the new identity before he or she earns the bonuses. Cover identities do not in themselves provide the epic infiltrator with additional skills, proficiencies, or class features that others might expect of the pretended professions. The epic infiltrator can switch cover identities or don a disguise using the Disguise skill in 1d3 minutes. He or she can also put on or take off armor in one-half the normal time.</div><div topic='Sneak Attack' level='8'><b>Sneak Attack:</b> If an epic infiltrator can catch an opponent when the opponent is unable to defend effectively from his or her attack, he or she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time the epic infiltrator's target would be denied his or her Dexterity bonus to AC (whether he or she actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the epic infiltrator's attack deals +1d6 points of damage. This extra damage increases by +1d6 points every three levels. Should the epic infiltrator score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is 30 feet away or less. With a sap or an unarmed strike, the epic infiltrator can make a sneak attack that deals subdual damage instead of normal damage. He or she cannot use a weapon that deals normal damage to deal subdual damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty. An epic infiltrator can only sneak attack living creatures with discernible anatomies-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Additionally, any creature immune to critical hits is similarly immune to sneak attacks. Also, the epic infiltrator must also be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach a vital spot. The epic infiltrator cannot sneak attack while striking at a creature with concealment or by striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach. If an epic infiltrator gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses to damage stack.</div><div topic='Specialist Training' level='8'><b>Specialist Training (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, the epic infiltrator gains the benefit of focusing his or her craft on a particular type of work, specializing in one of the following categories and receiving a +3 bonus on all checks with the listed skills. Every three levels thereafter, the epic infiltrator gains specialist training again. He or she may select the same category more than once._Concealment:_ Bluff, Disguise, and Forgery._Subterfuge:_ Hide, Move Silently, Open Lock, and Pick Pocket._Espionage:_ Listen, Search, and Spot._Interaction:_ Diplomacy, Gather Information, Intimidate, and Sense Motive.</div><div topic='Read Thoughts' level='8'><b>Read Thoughts (Su):</b> Beginning at 3rd level, the epic infiltrator can _detect thoughts_ as the spell cast by a 15th-level caster, except that it targets a single mind. Every four levels thereafter, the epic infiltrator can per-form this ability one additional time per day.</div><div topic='Far Senses' level='8'><b>Far Senses (Su):</b> Starting at 4th level, the epic infiltrator can extend his or her vision or hearing into an area beyond his or her normal range, once per day, to a distance of 20 feet plus an additional 20 feet per epic infiltrator level. The epic infiltrator must have personally visited the physical location earlier to use far senses on it. Barriers do not impede far senses, and low-light vision or darkvision function normally if the epic infiltrator has one or both of those abilities. Far senses can also apply to the epic infiltrator's read thoughts ability. Every two levels beyond 4th the epic infiltrator can perform this ability one additional time per day. This ability functions as the _clairaudience/clairvoyance_ spell cast by a 15th-level caster, except for the limit on range, the need to know the locale beforehand, and the ability to use the read thoughts ability.</div><div topic='Mind Blank' level='8'><b>_Mind Blank_ (Sp):</b> At 3rd level, the epic infiltrator can become immune to all mind-affecting spells and divinations once per day, plus one additional time per day every eight levels thereafter. This ability works as the _Mind Blank_ spell cast by a 15th-level caster.</div></div></div>    ",

It is possible that the character has higher-level aspects of the uncanny dodge ability. Whatever the level of uncanny dodge attained by the character, the guardian paramount can extend the features of his or her uncanny dodge ability to include any one creature he or she designates within 5 feet of him or her (he or she can designate a creature or change designations as a free action once per round). The guardian paramount can extend his or her uncanny dodge ability three times per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day every three levels thereafter.</div><div topic='Evasive Preceptor' level='8'><b>Evasive Preceptor (Ex):</b> The guardian paramount must have the evasion class feature, which allows the character to take no damage from an area attack with a successful Reflex save. He or she may also have improved evasion, though this is not a prerequisite. The character can extend evasion or improved evasion to include any one creature he or she designates within 5 feet of him or her. The guardian paramount can extend his or her evasion ability once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day every three levels thereafter.</div><div topic='Protective Aura' level='8'><b>_Protective Aura_ (Sp):</b> Starting at 3rd level, the guardian paramount can use a special form of _shield other_ once per day, plus one additional time per day every three levels thereafter. When a guardian paramount creates a _protective aura_, the transferred wounds are dealt to the guardian paramount as subdual damage, not normal damage, as with the _shield other_ spell. Otherwise, the guardian paramount's _Protective Aura_ functions like the _shield other spell_ cast by an 8th-level cleric.</div><div topic='Adjust Probability' level='8'><b>Adjust Probability (Ex):</b> On reaching 5th level, the guardian paramount gains the ability to affect probability twice per day, plus one additional time per day per three levels thereafter. The guardian paramount can force a reroll of one attack roll, check, or saving throw that another creature within 25 feet-friend or enemy-just made. The guardian paramount can find out whether the attack roll, check, or save would have succeeded before using this ability. The recipient must take the second roll, whether it's better or worse than the original roll. The use of this ability takes place outside the normal initiative order, but the paramount guardian can't use it if he or she is flat-footed or unable to see the situation resulting in the roll. The guardian paramount must decide whether to reroll as soon as the result of the attack roll, check, or save is known.</div><div topic='Call Back' level='8'><b>_Call Back_ (Sp):</b> On reaching 6th level, the guardian paramount gains the ability to return a dead creature that he or she has previously used any of his or her other class abilities on back to life, as if he or she had cast _true resurrection_ as a 20th-level cleric. The character can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day every six levels.</div></div></div>    ",

Any spell with a description that involves inflicting or channeling negative energy cast on a creature of the opposed alignment works as if under the effect of a Maximize Spell feat (without using a higher-level spell slot).

If the spell requires a melee touch attack, the hierophant must make a ranged touch attack instead. Divine reach can be selected a second time as a special ability, in which case the range increases to 60 feet._Faith Healing (Su):_ A hierophant can use healing spells to their maximum effect on creatures of the same alignment as the hierophant (including the hierophant himself ). Any spell with the healing descriptor cast on such creatures works as if under the effects of a Maximize Spell feat (without using a higher-level spell slot)._Gift of the Divine (Su):_ Available only to hierophants with cleric levels, this ability allows a hierophant to transfer one or more uses of his turn undead ability to a willing creature. (Hierophants who rebuke undead transfer uses of rebuke undead instead.) The transfer lasts anywhere from 24 hours to one week (chosen at the time of transfer), and while the transfer is in effect, the number of turning attempts per day allowed to the hierophant is reduced by the number transferred. The recipient turns undead as a cleric of the hierophant's cleric level but uses her own Charisma modifier._Mastery of Energy (Su):_ Available only to hierophants with cleric levels, this ability allows a hierophant to channel positive or negative energy much more effectively, increasing his ability to affect undead. Add a +4 bonus to the hierophant's turning checks and turning damage rolls. This ability only affects undead, even if the hierophant can turn other creatures, such as with a granted power of a domain._Metamagic Feat:_ A hierophant can choose a metamagic feat in place of one of the special abilities described here if desired._Power of Nature (Su):_ Available only to hierophants with druid levels, this ability allows a hierophant to temporarily transfer one or more of his druid Class Features to a willing creature. The transfer lasts anywhere from 24 hours to one week (chosen at the time of transfer), and while the transfer is in effect, the hierophant cannot use the transferred power. He can transfer any of his druid powers except spellcasting and the ability to have an animal companion.The druid's wild shape ability can be partially or completely transferred. The heirophant choses how many uses of wild shape per day to give to transfer and retains the rest of the uses for himself. If the hierophant can assume the form of Tiny or Huge animals, the recipient can as well.As with the _imbue with spell ability_ spell, the hierophant remains responsible to his deity for any use to which the recipient puts the transferred abilities._Spell Power:_ This special ability increases a hierophant's effective caster level by 1 for purposes of determining level-dependent spell variables and for caster level checks. This ability can be selected more than once, and changes to effective caster level are cumulative._Spell-Like Ability:_ A hierophant who selects this special ability can use one of his divine spell slots to permanently prepare one of his divine spells as a spell-like ability that can be used twice per day. The hierophant does not use any components when casting the spell, although a spell that costs XP to cast still does so, and a spell with a costly material component instead costs him 10 times that amount in XP.The spell normally uses a spell slot of the spell's level (or higher, if the hierophant chooses to permanently attach a metamagic feat to the spell chosen). The hierophant can use an available higher-level spell slot to use the spell-like ability more than once per day. Allocating a slot three levels higher allows him to cast the spell four times per day, and a slot six levels higher lets him cast it six times per day. If selected more than one time as a special ability, this ability can apply to the same spell (increasing the number of times per day it can be used) or to a different spell.</div></div></div>    ",

He or she may speak in such a manner once per day, plus one additional time per day per ten class levels thereafter._proselytize_ has three effects. First, any time the high proselytizer is speaking in this manner, he or she is treated as though affected by a _sanctuary_ spell. Second, his or her voice can be heard clearly by anyone within a radius of 100 feet plus 50 feet per class level, regardless of background noise, and his or her speech can be understood as though the audience were affected by a _comprehend languages_ spell. Finally, everyone in the range of the high proselytizer's voice immediately has a chance of becoming enraptured:<table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td><b>Type of Listener</b><br/></td><td><b>Effect</b><br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Followers of the same deity<br/></td><td>Automatic if 10 or fewer HD, otherwise Will save (DC 20 + 1/2 high proselytizer's class level + Wis modifier)<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Others of the same alignment<br/></td><td>Automatic if 5 or fewer HD, otherwise Will save (as above)<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>All others<br/></td><td>Will save (as above)<br/></td></tr></table>Enraptured audience members act as though affected by a _symbol of persuasion_, changing alignment as appropriate and otherwise functioning according to the _charm person_ spell. The high proselytizer can inspire the crowd to take any of a number of actions, depending on his or her alignment. Any suicidal suggestion grants audience members a new saving throw to break the rapture (with the exception of low-level followers of the same deity, who never got a save in the first place). This rapture lasts for 10 minutes plus an additional 5 minutes per high proselytizer level.At 3rd level, the high proselytizer's proselytize ability includes deific touch once per day, plus one additional time per day per ten levels thereafter. During his or her speech, the high proselytizer can move among the enraptured, shaking hands, caressing brows, and otherwise making contact with audience members. Anyone so touched is healed of 1d4 points of damage and cured of any natural disease or poison. Up to six individuals per round can be so affected. An audience member can only benefit from deific touch once per proselytize session. The high proselytizer can use deific touch as long as his or her proselytize ability lasts.At 5th level, the _proselytize_ ability includes _deific word_ once per day, plus one additional time per day per ten levels thereafter. The words spoken by the high proselytizer can, if he or she chooses, function as a triple-strength _sound burst_ spell (3d8 points of sonic damage and a Will save to avoid being stunned for 3 rounds) to all who are not enraptured, as the spell cast by a 20th-level cleric. The _deific word_ can occur at any point during his or her _proselytize_ speech.At 7th level, the _proselytize_ ability includes _deific face_ once per day, plus one additional time per day per ten levels thereafter. When the high proselytizer speaks, he or she can cause a blinding burst to shine from his or her face. _deific face_ functions against all in the audience who are not enraptured as the _sunburst_ spell cast by a 20th-level cleric. The _deific face_ can occur at any point during his or her speech.At 9th level, the _proselytize_ ability includes _Deific aura_ once per day, plus one additional time per day per ten levels thereafter. When the high proselytizer speaks, he or she can cause a rolling wave of deific power to spring from his or her body that functions as either a _blasphemy_,  _dictum_,  _holy word_,  or _word of chaos_ spell (as appropriate for his or her alignment), affecting only those in the audience who have resisted becoming enraptured. _Deific aura_ otherwise functions as the relevant spell cast by a 20th-level cleric. The _Deific aura_ can occur at any point during his or her speech.</div><div topic='Heal' level='8'><b>_heal_ (Sp):</b> At 2nd level, the high proselytizer can use _heal_ on his or herself or another creature once per day, plus one additional time per day per four levels thereafter.</div><div topic='Bonus Feats' level='8'><b>Bonus Feats:</b> The high proselytizer gets a bonus feat at 4th level and an additional bonus feat every four levels thereafter.

In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level).These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.</div><div topic='Flurry of Blows' level='8'><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex):</b> When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. The resulting modified base attack bonuses are shown in the Flurry of Blows Attack Bonus column on Table: The Monk. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affects attacks of opportunity the monk might make before her next action. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. A monk must use a full attack action to strike with a flurry of blows.When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special monk weapons (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham). She may attack with unarmed strikes and special monk weapons interchangeably as desired. When using weapons as part of a flurry of blows, a monk applies her Strength bonus (not Str bonus x 1-1/2 or x1/2) to her damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether she wields a weapon in one or both hands. The monk can't use any weapon other than a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows.In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of using the flurry of blows ability. Even though the quarterstaff requires two hands to use, a monk may still intersperse unarmed strikes with quarterstaff strikes, assuming that she has enough attacks in her flurry of blows routine to do so.When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability improves. In addition to the standard single extra attack she gets from flurry of blows, she gets a second extra attack at her full base attack bonus.</div><div topic='Unarmed Strike' level='8'><b>Unarmed Strike:</b> At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk's attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.Usually a monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.A monk's unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown on Table: The Monk. The unarmed damage on Table: The Monk is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage.<table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'><tr maxcol='4' curcol='2'><td colspan='3'><b>Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage</b><br/></td> </tr><tr maxcol='4' curcol='4'><td><b>Level</b><br/></td><td><b>Damage</b><br/> (<b>Small Monk)</b><br/></td> <td><b>Damage</b><br/><b>(Large Monk)</b><br/></td> </tr><tr maxcol='4' curcol='4'><td>1st-3rd<br/></td><td>1d4<br/></td><td>1d8<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='4' curcol='4'><td>4th-7th<br/></td><td>1d6<br/></td><td>2d6<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='4' curcol='4'><td>8th-11th<br/></td><td>1d8<br/></td><td>2d8<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='4' curcol='4'><td>12th-15th<br/></td><td>1d10<br/></td><td>3d6<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='4' curcol='4'><td>16th-19th<br/></td><td>2d6<br/></td><td>3d8<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='4' curcol='4'><td>20th<br/></td><td>2d8<br/></td><td>4d8<br/></td></tr></table></div><div topic='Bonus Feat' level='8'><b>Bonus Feat:</b> At 1st level, a monk may select either Improved Grapple or Stunning Fist as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, she may select either Combat Reflexes or Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. At 6th level, she may select either Improved Disarm or Improved Trip as a bonus feat. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.</div><div topic='Evasion' level='8'><b>Evasion (Ex):</b> At 2nd level or higher if a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.</div><div topic='Fast Movement' level='8'><b>Fast Movement (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her speed, as shown on Table: The Monk. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</div><div topic='Still Mind' level='8'><b>Still Mind (Ex):</b> A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment.</div><div topic='Ki Strike' level='8'><b>_Ki_ Strike (Su):</b> At 4th level, a monk's unarmed attacks are empowered with _ki_. Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. _Ki_ strike improves with the character's monk level. At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. At 16th level, her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</div><div topic='Slow Fall' level='8'><b>Slow Fall (Ex):</b> At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent. When first using this ability, she takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The monk's ability to slow her fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with her monk level until at 20th level she can use a nearby wall to slow her descent and fall any distance without harm.</div><div topic='Purity of Body' level='8'><b>Purity of Body (Ex):</b> At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases except for supernatural and magical diseases.</div><div topic='Wholeness of Body' level='8'><b>Wholeness of Body (Su):</b> At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal her own wounds. She can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice her current monk level each day, and she can spread this healing out among several uses.</div><div topic='Improved Evasion' level='8'><b>Improved Evasion (Ex):</b> At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</div><div topic='Diamond Body' level='8'><b>Diamond Body (Su):</b> At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.</div><div topic='Abundant Step' level='8'><b>Abundant Step (Su):</b> At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell _dimension door_,  once per day. Her caster level for this effect is one-half her monk level (rounded down).</div><div topic='Diamond Soul' level='8'><b>Diamond Soul (Ex):</b> At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to her current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk's spell resistance.</div><div topic='Quivering Palm' level='8'><b>Quivering Palm (Su):</b> Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. She can use this quivering palm attack once a week, and she must announce her intent before making her attack roll. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to her monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time.</div><div topic='Timeless Body' level='8'><b>Timeless Body (Ex):</b> Upon attaining 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to her ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that she has already taken, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when her time is up.</div><div topic='Tongue of the Sun and Moon' level='8'><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex):</b> A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.</div><div topic='Empty Body' level='8'><b>Empty Body (Su):</b> At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 round per monk level per day, as though using the spell _etherealness_. She may go ethereal on a number of different occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds spent in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.</div><div topic='Perfect Self' level='8'><b>Perfect Self:</b> At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk's creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonmagical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type.</div></div><div topic='Ex-Monks' level='5'><h5><b>Ex-Monks</b></h5>A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.Like a member of any other class, a monk may be a multiclass character, but multiclass monks face a special restriction. A monk who gains a new class or (if already multiclass) raises another class by a level may never again raise her monk level, though she retains all her monk abilities.</div></div>    ",

features of the paladin.<div topic='Weapon and Armor Proficiency' level='8'><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</div><div topic='Aura of Good' level='8'><b>Aura of Good (Ex):</b> The power of a paladin's aura of good (see the _detect good_ spell) is equal to her paladin level.</div><div topic='Detect Evil' level='8'><b>_Detect Evil_ (Sp):</b> At will, a paladin can use _detect evil_, as the spell.</div><div topic='Smite Evil' level='8'><b>Smite Evil (Su):</b> Once per day, a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level. If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day.At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: The Paladin, to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.</div><div topic='Divine Grace' level='8'><b>Divine Grace (Su):</b> At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</div><div topic='Lay on Hands' level='8'><b>Lay on Hands (Su):</b> Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level x her Charisma bonus. A paladin may choose to divide her healing among multiple recipients, and she doesn't have to use it all at once. Using lay on hands is a standard action.Alternatively, a paladin can use any or all of this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The paladin decides how many of her daily allotment of points to use as damage after successfully touching an undead creature.</div><div topic='Aura of Courage' level='8'><b>Aura of Courage (Su):</b> Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.</div><div topic='Divine Health' level='8'><b>Divine Health (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.</div><div topic='Turn Undead' level='8'><b>Turn Undead (Su):</b>When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to turn undead. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as a cleric of three levels lower would.</div><div topic='Spells' level='8'><b>Spells:</b> Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the paladin spell list. A paladin must choose and prepare her spells in advance.To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a paladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the paladin's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a paladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Paladin. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score. When Table: The Paladin indicates that the paladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level The paladin does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.A paladin prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to spontaneously cast a _cure_ spell in its place. A paladin may prepare and cast any spell on the paladin spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, her caster level is one-half her paladin level.</div><div topic='Special Mount' level='8'><b>_Special Mount_ (Sp):</b> Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin gains the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade against evil (see below). This mount is usually a heavy warhorse (for a Medium paladin) or a warpony (for a Small paladin).Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call her mount from the celestial realms in which it resides. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin's level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin and remains for 2 hours per paladin level; it may be dismissed at any time as a free action. The mount is the same creature each time it is summoned, though the paladin may release a particular mount from service.Each time the mount is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously. The mount also appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed. Calling a mount is a conjuration (calling) effect.Should the paladin's mount die, it immediately disappears, leaving behind any equipment it was carrying. The paladin may not summon another mount for thirty days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first, even if the mount is somehow returned from the dead. During this thirty-day period, the paladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</div><div topic='Remove Disease' level='8'><b>_Remove Disease_ (Sp):</b> At 6th level, a paladin can produce a _Remove Disease_ effect, as the spell, once per week. She can use this ability one additional time per week for every three levels after 6th (twice per week at 9th, three times at 12th, and so forth).</div><div topic='Code of Conduct' level='8'><b>Code of Conduct:</b> A paladin must be of lawful good alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits an evil act.Additionally, a paladin's code requires that she respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using poison, and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use the help for evil or chaotic ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents.</div><div topic='Associates' level='8'><b>Associates:</b> While she may adventure with characters of any good or neutral alignment, a paladin will never knowingly associate with evil characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her moral code. A paladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are lawful good.</div></div><div topic='Ex-Paladins' level='5'><h5><b>Ex-Paladins</b></h5>A paladin who ceases to be lawful good, who willfully commits an evil act, or who grossly violates the code of conduct loses all paladin spells and abilities (including the service of the paladin's mount, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She may not progress any farther in levels as a paladin. She regains her abilities and advancement potential if she atones for her violations (see the _atonement_ spell description), as appropriate.Like a member of any other class, a paladin may be a multiclass character, but multiclass paladins face a special restriction. A paladin who gains a level in any class other than paladin may never again raise her paladin level, though she retains all her paladin abilities.</div><div topic='Paladin's Mount' level='3'>*The Paladin's Mount*The paladin's mount is superior to a normal mount of its kind and has special powers, as described below. The standard mount for a Medium paladin is a heavy warhorse, and the standard mount for a Small paladin is a warpony. Another kind of mount, such as a riding dog (for a halfling paladin) or a Large shark (for a paladin in an aquatic campaign) may be allowed as well.A paladin's mount is treated as a magical beast, not an animal, for the purpose of all effects that depend on its type (though it retains an animal's HD, base attack bonus, saves, skill points, and feats).<table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'><tr maxcol='7' curcol='7'><td><b>Paladin Level</b> <br/></td> <td><b>Bonus HD</b> <br/></td><td><b>Natural Armor Adj</b>. <br/></td><td><b>Str Adj</b>. <br/></td><td><b>Int</b> <br/></td><td><b>Special</b><br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='7' curcol='7'><td>5th-7th<br/></td><td>+2<br/></td><td>+4<br/></td><td>+1<br/></td><td>6<br/></td><td>Empathic link, improved evasion, share spells, share saving throws<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='7' curcol='7'><td>8th-10th<br/></td><td>+4<br/></td><td>+6<br/></td><td>+2<br/></td><td>7<br/></td><td>Improved speed<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='7' curcol='7'><td>11th-14th<br/></td><td>+6<br/></td><td>+8<br/></td><td>+3<br/></td><td>8<br/></td><td>_Command_ creatures of its kind<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='7' curcol='7'><td>15th-20th<br/></td><td>+8<br/></td><td>+10<br/></td><td>+4<br/></td><td>9<br/></td><td>Spell resistance<br/></td></tr></table><div topic='Paladin's Mount Basics' level='8'><b>Paladin's Mount Basics:</b> Use the base statistics for a creature of the mount's kind, but make changes to take into account the attributes and characteristics summarized on the table and described below._Bonus HD:_ Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Extra Hit Dice improve the mount's base attack and base save bonuses. A special mount's base attack bonus is equal to that of a cleric of a level equal to the mount's HD. A mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal's HD). The mount gains additional skill points or feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster's Hit Dice._Natural Armor Adj.:_ The number on the table is an improvement to the mount's existing natural armor bonus._Str Adj.:_ Add this figure to the mount's Strength score._Int:_ The mount's Intelligence score._Empathic Link (Su):_ The paladin has an empathic link with her mount out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The paladin cannot see through the mount's eyes, but they can communicate empathically.Note that even intelligent mounts see the world differently from humans, so misunderstandings are always possible.Because of this empathic link, the paladin has the same connection to an item or place that her mount does, just as with a master and his familiar (see Familiars)._Improved Evasion (Ex):_ When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a mount takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails._Share Spells:_ At the paladin's option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts on herself also affect her mount.The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the mount if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the mount again even if it returns to the paladin before the duration expires. Additionally, the paladin may cast a spell with a target of 'You' on her mount (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A paladin and her mount can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the mount's type (magical beast)._Share Saving Throws:_ For each of its saving throws, the mount uses its own base save bonus or the paladin's, whichever is higher. The mount applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any other bonuses on saves that the master might have._Improved Speed (Ex):_ The mount's speed increases by 10 feet._Command (Sp):_ Once per day per two paladin levels of its master, a mount can use this ability to command other any normal animal of approximately the same kind as itself (for warhorses and warponies, this category includes donkeys, mules, and ponies), as long as the target creature has fewer Hit Dice than the mount. This ability functions like the _Command_ spell, but the mount must make a DC 21 Concentration check to succeed if it's being ridden at the time. If the check fails, the ability does not work that time, but it still counts against the mount's daily uses. Each target may attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin's level + paladin's Cha modifier) to negate the effect._Spell Resistance (Ex):_ A mount's spell resistance equals its master's paladin level + 5. To affect the mount with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the mount's spell resistance.</div></div></div>    ",

The _greater invisibility_ is as the spell cast by a 20th-level caster.</div><div topic='Improved Legerdemain' level='8'><b>Improved Legerdemain (Su):</b> A perfect wight can perform the following class skills at a range of 30 feet: Disable Device, Open Lock, Pick Pocket, and Search. If desired, the perfect wight can take 10 on the check. Any object manipulated during the skill check must weigh 100 pounds or less. Alternatively, the perfect wight can use improved legerdemain to make one melee sneak attack against any creature within 30 feet. The perfect wight executes the sneak attack (or death attack, if applicable) as if attacking from a flanking position. If the attack is successful, the victim is dealt the appropriate sneak attack damage despite the fact that the perfect wight and his or her weapon do not physically cross the intervening distance. A perfect wight can use improved legerdemain once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter.</div><div topic='Incorporeal' level='8'><b>Incorporeal (Su):</b> At 3rd level, the perfect wight can become incorporeal once per day, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter. A perfect wight can remain incorporeal for a number of rounds equal to 20 + his or her perfect wight level. As an incorporeal creature, the perfect wight can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. He or she is immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, the perfect wight has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for force effects or attacks made with ghost touch weapons). An incorporeal perfect wight has no natural armor but has a deflection bonus equal to his or her Charisma modifier (always at least +1, even if his or her Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus). An incorporeal perfect wight can pass through solid objects at will, but not force effects. His or her attack ignores natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against it. An incorporeal perfect wight moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if he or she doesn't wish to be. While incorporeal, the perfect wight has no Strength score, so his or her Dexterity modifier applies to both melee and ranged attacks.</div><div topic='Shadow Form' level='8'><b>Shadow Form (Su):</b> At 4th level, the perfect wight can take shadow form once per day, plus one additional time per day every five levels thereafter. The perfect wight's shadow form lasts 1 minute per level of the prestige class. While in shadow form the perfect wight is incorporeal (see above), is immune to critical hits, and can fly at a speed of 100 feet (good). The perfect wight can also use the substance of his or her own shadow to enhance his or her effective level on any attack roll, check, or saving throw. Drawing power from his or her own shadow form deals the perfect wight 7 points of damage for each +1 bonus on a single roll or +1 effective level for any other single use.</div><div topic='Bonus Feats' level='8'><b>Bonus Feats:</b> The perfect wight gets a bonus feat at 5th level and an additional bonus feat every five levels thereafter. These bonus feats must be selected from the following list: Blinding Speed, Combat Archery, Dexterous Fortitude, Dexterous Will, Epic Dodge, Epic Reputation, Epic Skill Focus, Epic Speed, Epic Trapfinding, Improved Combat Reflexes, Improved Sneak Attack, Legendary Climber, Lingering Damage, Self-Concealment, Sneak Attack of Opportunity, Spellcasting Harrier, Superior Initiative, Uncanny Accuracy.</div></div></div>    ",

psion.<div topic='Weapon and Armor Proficiency' level='8'><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Psions are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, quarterstaff, and shortspear. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor does not, however, interfere with the manifestation of powers.</div><div topic='Power Points/Day' level='8'><b>Power Points/Day:</b> A psion's ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table: The Psion. In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points). His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items.</div><div topic='Discipline' level='8'><b>Discipline:</b> Every psion must decide at 1st level which psionic discipline he will specialize in. Choosing a discipline provides a psion with access to the class skills associated with that discipline (see above), as well as the powers restricted to that discipline. However, choosing a discipline also means that the psion cannot learn powers that are restricted to other disciplines. He can't even use such powers by employing psionic items.</div><div topic='Powers Known' level='8'><b>Powers Known:</b> A psion begins play knowing three psion powers of your choice. Each time he achieves a new level, he unlocks the knowledge of new powers.Choose the powers known from the psion power list, or from the list of powers of your chosen discipline. You cannot choose powers from restricted discipline lists other than your own discipline list. You can choose powers from disciplines other than your own if they are not on a restricted discipline list. (_Exception:_ The feats Expanded Knowledge and Epic Expanded Knowledge do allow a psion to learn powers from the lists of other disciplines or even other classes.) A psion can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester level.The number of times a psion can manifest powers in a day is limited only by his daily power points.A psion simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the way that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though he must get a good night's sleep each day to regain all his spent power points.</div><div topic='Maximum Power Level Known' level='8'>The Difficulty Class for saving throws against psion powers is 10 + the power's level + the psion's Intelligence modifier. <b>Maximum Power Level Known:</b> A psion begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level powers. As he attains higher levels, a psion may gain the ability to master more complex powers.To learn or manifest a power, a psion must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the power's level.</div><div topic='Bonus Feats' level='8'><b>Bonus Feats:</b> A psion gains a bonus feat at 1st level, 5th level, 10th level, 15th level, and 20th level. This feat must be a psionic feat, a metapsionic feat, or a psionic item creation feat.These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gains every three levels. A psion is not limited to psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats when choosing these other feats.</div></div><div topic='Psionic Disciplines' level='3'>*Psionic Disciplines*A discipline is one of six groupings of powers, each defined by a common theme. The six disciplines are clairsentience, metacreativity, psychokinesis, psychometabolism, psychoportation, and telepathy.<div topic='Clairsentience' level='8'><b>Clairsentience:</b> A psion who chooses clairsentience is known as a seer. Seers can learn precognitive powers to aid their comrades in combat, as well as powers that permit them to gather information in many different ways.</div><div topic='Metacreativity' level='8'><b>Metacreativity:</b> A psion specializing in metacreativity is known as a shaper. This discipline includes powers that draw ectoplasm or matter from the Astral Plane, creating semisolid and solid items such as armor, weapons, or animated constructs to do battle at the shaper's command.</div><div topic='Psychokinesis' level='8'><b>Psychokinesis:</b> Psions who specialize in psychokinesis are known as kineticists. They are the masters of powers that manipulate and transform matter and energy. Kineticists can attack with devastating blasts of energy.</div><div topic='Psychometabolism' level='8'><b>Psychometabolism:</b> A psion who specializes in psychometabolism is known as an egoist. This discipline consists of powers that alter the psion's psychobiology, or that of creatures near him. An egoist can both heal and transform himself into a fearsome fighter.</div><div topic='Psychoportation' level='8'><b>Psychoportation:</b> A psion who relies on psychoportation powers is known as a nomad. Nomads can wield powers that propel or displace objects in space or time.</div><div topic='Telepathy' level='8'><b>Telepathy:</b> A psion who chooses the discipline of telepathy is known as a telepath. He is the master of powers that allow mental contact and control of other sentient creatures. A telepath can deceive or destroy the minds of his enemies with ease.</div></div><div topic='Psicrystals' level='3'>*Psicrystals*A psicrystal is a fragment of a psionic character's personality, brought into physical form and a semblance of life (via the Psicrystal Affinity feat). A psicrystal appears as a crystalline construct about the size of a human hand.Because it is an extension of its creator's personality, a character's psicrystal is in some ways a part of him. That's why, for example, a psionic character can manifest a personal range power on his psicrystal even though normally he can manifest such a power only on himself.A psicrystal is treated as a construct for the purposes of all effects that depend on its type.A psicrystal grants special abilities to its owner, as shown on the Psicrystal Special Abilities table below. In addition, a psicrystal has a personality (being a fragment of the owner's personality), which gives its owner a bonus on certain types of checks or saving throws, as given on the Psicrystal Personalities table below. These special abilities and bonuses apply only when the owner and the psicrystal are within 1 mile of each other.Psicrystal abilities are based on the owner's levels in psionic classes. Levels from other classes do not count toward the owner's level for purposes of psicrystal abilities.A psicrystal can speak one language of its owner's choice (so long as it is a language the owner knows). A psicrystal can understand all other languages known by its owner, but cannot speak them. This is a supernatural ability.<div topic='Psicrystal Basics' level='8'><b>Psicrystal Basics:</b> Use the statistics for a psicrystal, but make the following changes._Saving Throws:_ A psicrystal uses its owner's base saving throw bonuses and ability modifiers on saves, though it doesn't enjoy any other bonuses its owner might have (from magic items or feats, for example)._Abilities:_ When its self-propulsion ability is not activated, a psicrystal has no Strength score and no Dexterity score._Skills:_ A psicrystal has the same skill ranks as its owner, except that it has a minimum of 4 ranks each in Spot, Listen, Move Silently, and Search. (Even if its owner has no ranks in these skills, a psicrystal has 4 ranks in each.) A psicrystal uses its own ability modifiers on skill checks.<table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'><tr maxcol='5' curcol='2'><td colspan='4'><b>Psicrystal Special Abilities</b><br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td><b>Owner Level</b><br/></td><td><b>Natural Armor Adj</b>.<br/></td><td><b>Int Adj</b>.<br/></td><td><b>Special</b><br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>1st-2nd<br/></td><td>+0<br/></td><td>+0<br/></td><td>Alertness, improved evasion, personality, self-propulsion, share powers, sighted, telepathic link<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>3rd-4th<br/></td><td>+1<br/></td><td>+1<br/></td><td>Deliver touch powers<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>5th-6th<br/></td><td>+2<br/></td><td>+2<br/></td><td>Telepathic speech<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>7th-8th<br/></td><td>+3<br/></td><td>+3<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>9th-10th<br/></td><td>+4<br/></td><td>+4<br/></td><td>Flight<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>11th-12th<br/></td><td>+5<br/></td><td>+5<br/></td><td>Power resistance<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>13th-14th<br/></td><td>+6<br/></td><td>+6<br/></td><td>Sight link<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>15th-16th<br/></td><td>+7<br/></td><td>+7<br/></td><td>Channel power<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>17th-18th<br/></td><td>+8<br/></td><td>+8<br/></td><td/></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>19th-20th<br/></td><td>+9<br/></td><td>+9<br/></td><td/></tr></table></div><div topic='Psicrystal Ability Descriptions' level='8'><b>Psicrystal Ability Descriptions:</b> All psicrystals have special abilities (or impart abilities to their owners) depending on the level of the owner, as shown on the table above. The abilities on the table are cumulative._Natural Armor Adj. (Ex):_ This number noted here is an improvement to the psicrystal's natural armor bonus (normally 0). It represents a psicrystal's preternatural durability._Intelligence Adj. (Ex):_ Add this value to the psicrystal's Intelligence score. Psicrystals are as smart as people (though not necessarily as smart as smart people)._Alertness (Ex):_ The presence of a psicrystal sharpens its master's senses. While a psicrystal is within arm's reach (adjacent to or in the same square as its owner), its owner gains the Alertness feat._Improved Evasion (Ex):_ If a psicrystal is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw fails._Personality (Ex):_ Every psicrystal has a personality. See Psicrystal Personality, below._Self-Propulsion (Su):_ As a standard action, its owner can will a psicrystal to form spidery, ectoplasmic legs that grant the psicrystal a land speed of 30 feet and a climb speed of 20 feet. The legs fade into nothingness after one day (or sooner, if the owner desires)._Share Powers (Su):_ At the owner's option, he can have any power (but not any psi-like ability) he manifests on himself also affect his psicrystal. The psicrystal must be within 5 feet of him at the time of the manifestation to receive the benefit. If the power has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the psicrystal if it moves farther than 5 feet away, and will not affect the psicrystal again, even if it returns to its owner before the duration expires.Additionally, the owner can manifest a power with a target of 'You' on his psicrystal (as a touch range power) instead of on himself. The owner and psicrystal cannot share powers if the powers normally do not affect creatures of the psicrystal's type (construct)._Sighted (Ex):_ Although it has no physical sensory organs, a psicrystal can telepathically sense its environment as well as a creature with normal vision and hearing. Darkness (even supernatural darkness) is irrelevant, as are areas of supernatural silence, though a psicrystal still can't discern invisible or ethereal beings. A psicrystal's sighted range is 40 feet._Telepathic Link (Su):_ The owner has a telepathic link with his psicrystal out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The owner cannot see through the psicrystal's senses, but the two of them can communicate telepathically as if the psicrystal were the target of a _mindlink_ power manifested by the owner. For instance, a psicrystal placed in a distant room could relay the activities occurring in that room.Because of the telepathic link between a psicrystal and its owner, the owner has the same connection to an item or place that the psicrystal does. For instance, if his psicrystal has seen a room, the owner can teleport into that room as if he has seen it too._Deliver Touch Powers (Su):_ If the owner is 3rd level or higher, his psicrystal can deliver touch powers for him. If the owner and psicrystal are in contact at the time the owner manifests a touch power, he can designate his psicrystal as the 'toucher.' The psicrystal can then deliver the touch power just as the owner could. As usual, if the owner manifests another power before the touch is delivered, the touch power dissipates._Telepathic Speech (Ex):_ If the owner is 5th level or higher, the psicrystal can communicate telepathically with any creature that has a language and is within 30 feet of the psicrystal, while the psicrystal is also within 1 mile of the owner._Flight (Su):_ If the owner is 9th level or higher, he can, as a standard action, will his psicrystal to fly at a speed of 50 feet (poor). The psicrystal drifts gently to the ground after one day (or sooner, if the owner desires)._Power Resistance (Ex):_ If the owner is 11th level or higher, the psicrystal gains power resistance equal to the owner's level + 5. To affect the psicrystal with a power, another manifester must get a result on a manifester level check that equals or exceeds the psicrystal's power resistance._Sight Link (Sp):_ If the owner is 13th level or higher, the character can remote view the psicrystal (as if manifesting the _remote view_ power) once per day._Channel Power (Sp):_ If the owner is 15th level or higher, he can manifest powers through the psicrystal to a distance of up to 1 mile. The psicrystal is treated as the power's originator, and all ranges are calculated from its location.When channeling a power through his psicrystal, the owner manifests the power by paying its power point cost. He is still subject to attacks of opportunity and other hazards of manifesting a power, if applicable (for instance, he becomes visible when manifesting an offensive power if _invisible_, as does the psicrystal).</div><div topic='Psicrystal Personality' level='8'><b>Psicrystal Personality (Ex):</b> Each psicrystal has a distinct personality, chosen by its owner at the time of its creation from among those given on the following table. At 1st level, its owner typically gets a feel for a psicrystal's personality only through occasional impulses, but as the owner increases in level the psicrystal's personality becomes more pronounced. At higher levels, it is not uncommon for a psicrystal to constantly ply its owner with observations and advice, often severely slanted toward the psicrystal's particular worldview. The owner always sees a bit of himself in his psicrystal, even if magnified and therefore distorted.<table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'><tr maxcol='3' curcol='2'><td colspan='2'><b>Psicrystal Personalities</b><br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td><b>Personality</b><br/></td><td><b>Benefit to Owner</b><br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Artiste<br/></td><td>+3 bonus on Craft checks<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Bully<br/></td><td>+3 bonus on Intimidate checks<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Coward<br/></td><td>+3 bonus on Hide checks<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Friendly<br/></td><td>+3 bonus on Diplomacy checks<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Hero<br/></td><td>+2 bonus on Fortitude saves<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Liar<br/></td><td>+3 bonus on Bluff checks<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Meticulous<br/></td><td>+3 bonus on Search checks<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Nimble<br/></td><td>+2 bonus on Initiative checks<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Observant<br/></td><td>+3 bonus on Spot checks<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Poised<br/></td><td>+3 bonus on Balance checks<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Resolved<br/></td><td>+2 bonus on Will saves<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Sage<br/></td><td>+3 bonus on checks involving any one Knowledge skill owner already knows; once chosen, this does not vary<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Single-minded<br/></td><td>+3 bonus on Concentration checks<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Sneaky<br/></td><td>+3 bonus on Move Silently checks<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Sympathetic<br/></td><td>+3 bonus on Sense Motive checks<br/></td></tr></table></div></div></div>    ",

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus feats, metapsionic or item creation feats, psicrystal special abilities, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of psion uncarnate to the level of whatever manifesting class the character has, then determines power points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly.If a character had more than one manifesting class before he became a psion uncarnate, he must decide to which class he adds the new level of psion uncarnate for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester level.</div><div topic='Incorporeal Touch' level='8'><b>Incorporeal Touch (Su):</b> Beginning at 1st level, a psion uncarnate can make up to three melee touch attacks per day that each deal 1d6 points of damage if they hit. The character's Strength modifier is not applied to this attack, but it is effective against incorporeal creatures (and against corporeal creatures while the psion uncarnate is incorporeal) The character's hand and arm seem to become slightly translucent when he makes these attacks. A miss still counts as a use of the ability.While uncarnate (see below), a psion uncarnate can make melee touch attacks at will that do not count against his uses of this ability.For every four levels higher than 1st the psion uncarnate attains, the damage on these attacks increases by 1d6 points.</div><div topic='Uncarnate Armor' level='8'><b>Uncarnate Armor (Su):</b> A psion uncarnate wearing armor (or using _inertial armor_ or a similar effect) gets his armor bonus to AC even when he becomes incorporeal (see Shed Body, below). However, unlike other incorporeal creatures, a psion uncarnate does not gain a deflection bonus to Armor Class from his Charisma modifier. This ability works even if the armor being worn becomes incorporeal (such as through the use of the assume equipment ability described below).</div><div topic='Shed Body' level='8'><b>Shed Body (Su):</b> Starting at 2nd level, a psion uncarnate can become incorporeal (or 'uncarnate') once per day as a standard action. The character can remain uncarnate for up to 1 minute. During this time, the character's body fades into an immaterial form that retains the character's basic likeness. While uncarnate, the character gains the incorporeal subtype (see below). He gains a fly speed equal to his land speed (perfect maneuverability). His material armor remains in place and continues to provide its armor bonus to AC (see Uncarnate Armor, above). His material weapons also remain corporeal. Losing his physical form allows the character to more easily access his mental abilities, and he gains a +1 bonus on all save DCs for powers he manifests while uncarnate.He can use equipment normally, deriving benefits from items that enhance his capabilities; however, all his equipment remains material even when the character is uncarnate (but see the assume equipment ability, described below).Often, a psion uncarnate appears almost like a ghost wearing items of the material world. This doesn't make his equipment more susceptible to attack (the normal rules for attended objects apply), but it does make it impossible for the character to enter or pass through solid objects while wearing solid equipment. If he drops his material equipment, he can pass through solid objects at will as described below.At 6th level and higher, a psion uncarnate can shed his body twice per day for up to 1 minute each time._Incorporeal Subtype:_ An incorporeal psion uncarnate has no physical body. He can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. He is immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, he has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects,  or attacks made with _ghost touch_ weapons).An incorporeal psion uncarnate has no natural armor bonus-and, unlike other incorporeal creatures, does not gain a deflection bonus from his Charisma modifier. An incorporeal psion uncarnate can enter or pass through solid objects (subject to the restrictions described in the shed body and assume equipment abilities), but must remain adjacent to the object's exterior, and so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than his own. He can sense the presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to his current location, but enemies have total concealment (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal psion uncarnate that is inside an object. To see farther from the object he is in and attack normally, the incorporeal psion uncarnate must emerge. An incorporeal psion uncarnate inside an object has total cover, but when he attacks a creature outside the object he only has cover, so a creature outside with a readied action could strike at him as he attacks. An incorporeal psion uncarnate cannot pass through a force effect.An incorporeal psion uncarnate's attacks pass through (ignore) natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against him. He can pass through and operate in water as easily as he does in air. An incorporeal psion uncarnate cannot fall or take falling damage. He cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can he be tripped or grappled. In fact, he cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor is he subject to such actions.Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight. An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesn't wish to be. It has no Strength score, so its Dexterity modifier applies to both its melee attack rolls and its ranged attack rolls. Nonvisual senses, such as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to incorporeal creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when they cannot see.</div><div topic='Assume Equipment' level='8'><b>Assume Equipment (Su):</b> Beginning at 3rd level, a psion uncarnate can designate a number of pieces of his worn equipment (including armor and weapons) equal to his psion uncarnate level to become incorporeal when he uses his shed body ability. This has no effect on the equipment's function, but now when the psion uncarnate is incorporeal, he can enter or pass through solid objects while wearing nothing other than the designated equipment. Once designated, the equipment automatically changes to incorporeal when the character sheds his body, and it returns to corporeality when the character does. The character can change his designations as he desires.</div><div topic='Assume Likeness' level='8'><b>Assume Likeness (Su):</b> At 4th level and higher, while incorporeal, a psion uncarnate can assume the likeness of any Small, Medium, or Large creature as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The character's abilities do not change, but he appears to be the creature that he assumes the likeness of, allowing him the ability to effectively disguise himself and bluff those who might wonder at his true nature. Each physical interaction with a creature requires a successful Bluff check (opposed by the creature's Sense Motive check) to convince the creature of the psion uncarnate's new appearance. The psion uncarnate must not do anything to give away his true (incorporeal) nature in order for the bluff to be successful; for instance, if he accepts an item from another creature only to have it fall through his immaterial hands, the Bluff check automatically fails. However, a Bluff check would be allowed if the psion uncarnate uses his telekinetic force ability (see below) to hold the received item.When using his assume likeness ability, a psion uncarnate has an additional +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If he can read an opponent's mind, he gets a further +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks.</div><div topic='Telekinetic Force' level='8'><b>Telekinetic Force (Su):</b> Beginning at 7th level, while incorporeal, a psion uncarnate can use a telekinetic force effect as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The save DC is equal to 14 + the psion uncarnate's key ability modifier (either Int, Wis, or Cha). The character's manifester level is the manifester level of the effect.Even while corporeal, a psion uncarnate can use this ability, but only three times per day (uses while he is uncarnate do not count against this use limit).</div><div topic='Uncarnate Bridge' level='8'><b>Uncarnate Bridge (Su):</b> At 8th level, as a creature of almost pure mind, a psion uncarnate becomes more closely attuned to the minds of other creatures. He gains the ability to transport himself via the minds of living creatures. Once per day as a standard action while incorporeal, he can seamlessly enter any living creature with an Intelligence score and pass to another living creature with an Intelligence score that is within line of sight of the first creature.The psion uncarnate must be in a space adjacent to the entry creature before transporting, and he appears in a space adjacent to the destination creature after transporting. The entry and destination creatures need not be familiar to the character. A psion uncarnate cannot use himself as the entry or destination creature. Neither creature need be a willing participant.When exiting the destination creature, the psion uncarnate chooses an adjacent square in which to appear. Entering and leaving a creature is painless, unless the psion uncarnate wishes otherwise (see below). In most cases, though, the destination creature finds being the endpoint of a mental bridge surprising and quite unsettling.If he desires, a psion uncarnate can destructively exit the destination creature. If the creature fails a Will save (DC 15 + psion uncarnate's key ability modifier), the exiting psion uncarnate tunes his mental form to destructively interfere with the target's mind. He bursts forth explosively from the creature's body, dealing it 10d6 points of damage.</div><div topic='Uncarnate' level='8'><b>Uncarnate (Ex):</b> At 10th level, a psion uncarnate becomes a being of pure psionic consciousness. This ability is similar to shed body, except the character is permanently incorporeal (and gains that subtype). If the character desires, he can become corporeal once per day for up to 1 minute, but he spends the rest of his time as an entity of mind untethered by the physical world.</div></div></div>    ",

Flames engulf one of the pyrokineticist's hands (but do her no harm). Her unarmed attacks with that hand are treated as armed. Such attacks deal an extra 2d6 points of fire damage.</div><div topic='Bolt of Fire' level='8'><b>_Bolt of Fire_ (Ps):</b> Starting at 3rd level, as a standard action, a pyrokineticist can launch a bolt of psionically manifested fire at any target in line of sight within 60 feet. This effect is treated as a ranged touch attack and deals 1d6 points of fire damage for each class level the pyro has.</div><div topic='Weapon Afire' level='8'><b>_Weapon Afire_ (Ps):</b> At 4th level and higher, a pyrokineticist can activate this ability as a move-equivalent action. Flames that harm neither her nor the weapon engulf one weapon she holds (which can be a projectile such as a stone, bullet, arrow, or bolt). The weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit. The weapon retains this effect for as long as the pyrokineticist wields it.</div><div topic='Nimbus' level='8'><b>_Nimbus_ (Ps):</b> Beginning at 5th level, a pyrokineticist can activate this ability as a move-equivalent action. Flames that harm neither the pyrokineticist nor her equipment engulf her entire body. While she is aflame, the character's Charisma score increases by 4, she can make a melee touch attack for 2d6 points of fire damage, and she gains damage reduction 5/magic. If she is struck in melee, the attacker takes 2d6 points of fire damage. This ability lasts for up to 1 minute per pyrokineticist level and is usable once per day.</div><div topic='Firewalk' level='8'><b>Firewalk (Su):</b> Beginning at 6th level, as a free action a pyrokineticist can expend her psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description) to literally walk on air. She moves at her normal speed in all directions, including vertically, but cannot move more than double her speed in a round. A firewalking pyro leaves footprints of flame in the air that disperse in 2 rounds, but her tread does not deal damage. She must pay 1 power point per round spent traveling in this fashion.</div><div topic='Fear No Fire' level='8'><b>Fear No Fire (Ex):</b> At 7th level, a pyrokineticist becomes highly resistant to fire, gaining a +8 bonus on all saving throws against fire and heat spells and effects and also gaining fire resistance 20.</div><div topic='Greater Weapon Afire' level='8'><b>_Greater Weapon Afire_ (Ps):</b> At 8th level, when a pyrokineticist activates her hand afire ability or her weapon afire ability, her unarmed attack or weapon deals an extra 4d6 points of fire damage instead of 2d6. Touch attacks made while she uses the nimbus ability likewise deal 4d6 points of damage instead of 2d6.</div><div topic='Heat Death' level='8'><b>_Heat Death_ (Ps):</b> A pyrokineticist who reaches 9th level can expend her psionic focus and take a full attack action to raise the internal temperature of one living creature within 30 feet to lethal levels. The target must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw (DC 14 + pyro's Cha modifier) or die horrifically as its blood (or other internal fluid) boils. Even on a successful save, the target takes 4d8 points of fire damage from the heat.</div><div topic='Conflagration' level='8'><b>_Conflagration_ (Ps):</b> At 10th level, a pyrokineticist gains the ability to create a massive burst of raging flames around herself, burning everything in the area. Once per day, as a standard action, she can use this ability to deal 15d6 points of fire damage in a 30-foot-radius burst emanating from herself. Any creature or object caught in the burst can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 15 + pyro's Cha modifier) for half damage. Anyone failing the Reflex save against the _Conflagration_ must also make a Fortitude saving throw (same DC) or die due to extreme shock from the intense heat.</div></div></div>    ",

Favored Enemies. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table.

This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a -4 penalty on the check.</div><div topic='Combat Style' level='8'><b>Combat Style (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. This choice affects the character's class features but does not restrict his selection of feats or special abilities in any way.If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.The benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.</div><div topic='Endurance' level='8'><b>Endurance:</b> A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</div><div topic='Animal Companion' level='8'><b>Animal Companion (Ex):</b> At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures may be added to the ranger's list of options: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind.This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name, except that the ranger's effective druid level is one-half his ranger level. A ranger may select from the alternative lists of animal companions just as a druid can, though again his effective druid level is half his ranger level. Like a druid, a ranger cannot select an alternative animal if the choice would reduce his effective druid level below 1st.</div><div topic='Spells' level='8'><b>Spells:</b> Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier.Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. When Table: The Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The ranger does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.A ranger prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though he cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a _cure_ spell in its place. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is one-half his ranger level.</div><div topic='Improved Combat Style' level='8'><b>Improved Combat Style (Ex):</b> At 6th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Manyshot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.</div><div topic='Woodland Stride' level='8'><b>Woodland Stride (Ex):</b> Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him.</div><div topic='Swift Tracker' level='8'><b>Swift Tracker (Ex):</b> Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. He takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</div><div topic='Evasion' level='8'><b>Evasion (Ex):</b> At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.</div><div topic='Combat Style Mastery' level='8'><b>Combat Style Mastery (Ex):</b> At 11th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves again. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Precise Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.</div><div topic='Camouflage' level='8'><b>Camouflage (Ex):</b> A ranger of 13th level or higher can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.</div><div topic='Hide in Plain Sight' level='8'><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex):</b> While in any sort of natural terrain, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Hide skill even while being observed.</div></div></div>    ",

Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</div><div topic='Sneak Attack' level='8'><b>Sneak Attack:</b> If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.The rogue's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty.A rogue can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible anatomies-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.</div><div topic='Trapfinding' level='8'><b>Trapfinding:</b> Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20.Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.A rogue who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.</div><div topic='Evasion' level='8'><b>Evasion (Ex):</b> At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</div><div topic='Trap Sense' level='8'><b>Trap Sense (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level.Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</div><div topic='Uncanny Dodge' level='8'><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</div><div topic='Improved Uncanny Dodge' level='8'><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> A rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked.This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</div><div topic='Special Abilities' level='8'><b>Special Abilities:</b> On attaining 10th level, and at every three levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th), a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among the following options._Crippling Strike (Ex):_ A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability._Defensive Roll (Ex):_ The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll-if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue's evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll._Improved Evasion (Ex):_ This ability works like evasion, except that while the rogue still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks henceforth she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion._Opportunist (Ex):_ Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as the rogue's attack of opportunity for that round. Even a rogue with the Combat Reflexes feat can't use the opportunist ability more than once per round._Skill Mastery:_ The rogue becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions.Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. A rogue may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for it to apply to each time._Slippery Mind (Ex):_ This ability represents the rogue's ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw._Feat:_ A rogue may gain a bonus feat in place of a special ability.</div></div></div>    ",

Shadowdancers are proficient with light armor but not with shields.</div><div topic='Hide in Plain Sight' level='8'><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Su):</b> A shadowdancer can use the Hide skill even while being observed. As long as she is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, a shadowdancer can hide herself from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind. She cannot, however, hide in her own shadow.</div><div topic='Evasion' level='8'><b>Evasion (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, a shadowdancer gains evasion. If exposed to any effect that normally allows her to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving throw. The evasion ability can only be used if the shadowdancer is wearing light armor or no armor.</div><div topic='Darkvision' level='8'><b>Darkvision (Su):</b> At 2nd level, a shadowdancer can see in the dark as though she were permanently under the effect of a _darkvision_ spell.</div><div topic='Uncanny Dodge' level='8'><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> Starting at 2nd level, a shadowdancer retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (She still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)If a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).</div><div topic='Shadow Illusion' level='8'><b>_Shadow Illusion_ (Sp):</b> When a shadowdancer reaches 3rd level, she can create visual illusions. This ability's effect is identical to that of the arcane spell _silent image_ and may be employed once per day.</div><div topic='Summon Shadow' level='8'><b>Summon Shadow (Su):</b> At 3rd level, a shadowdancer can summon a shadow, an undead shade. Unlike a normal shadow, this shadow's alignment matches that of the shadowdancer, and the creature cannot create spawn. The summoned shadow cannot be turned, rebuked, or commanded by any third party. This shadow serves as a companion to the shadowdancer and can communicate intelligibly with the shadowdancer. Every third level gained by the shadowdancer adds +2 HD (and the requisite base attack and base save bonus increases) to her shadow companion.If a shadow companion is destroyed, or the shadowdancer chooses to dismiss it, the shadowdancer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save. If the saving throw fails, the shadowdancer loses 200 experience points per shadowdancer level. A successful saving throw reduces the loss by half, to 100 XP per prestige class level. The shadowdancer's XP total can never go below 0 as the result of a shadow's dismissal or destruction. A destroyed or dismissed shadow companion cannot be replaced for 30 days.</div><div topic='Shadow Jump' level='8'><b>Shadow Jump (Su):</b> At 4th level, a shadowdancer gains the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a _dimension door_ spell. The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. A shadowdancer can jump up to a total of 20 feet each day in this way; this may be a single jump of 20 feet or two jumps of 10 feet each. Every two levels higher than 4th, the distance a shadowdancer can jump each day doubles (40 feet at 6th, 80 feet at 8th, and 160 feet at 10th). This amount can be split among many jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment.</div><div topic='Defensive Roll' level='8'><b>Defensive Roll (Ex):</b> Starting at 5th level, once per day, when a shadowdancer would be reduced to 0 hit points or less by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), she can attempt to roll with the damage. She makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt) and, if successful, takes only half damage from the blow. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll. If she is in a situation that would deny her any Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't attempt a defensive roll.</div><div topic='Improved Uncanny Dodge' level='8'><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> At 5th level, a shadowdancer can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the shadowdancer. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the shadowdancer can flank her (and thus sneak attack her).If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</div><div topic='Slippery Mind' level='8'><b>Slippery Mind (Ex):</b> At 7th level, if a shadowdancer is affected by an enchantment and fails her saving throw, 1 round later she can attempt her saving throw again. She only gets this one extra chance to succeed at her saving throw. If it fails as well, the spell's effects occur normally.</div><div topic='Improved Evasion' level='8'><b>Improved Evasion (Ex):</b> This ability, gained at 10th level, works like evasion (see above). A shadowdancer takes no damage at all on successful saving throws against attacks that allow a Reflex saving throw for half damage. What's more, she takes only half damage even if she fails her saving throw.</div></div></div>    ",

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus feats, metapsionic or item creation feats, psicrystal special abilities, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the level of slayer to the level of whatever manifesting class the character has, then determines power points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly.If a character had more than one manifesting class before she became a slayer, she must decide to which class she adds the new level of slayer for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester level.If the character did not belong to a manifesting class before taking this prestige class, she does not gain manifesting levels.</div><div topic='Favored Enemy' level='8'><b>Favored Enemy (Ex):</b> When she enters the class, a slayer formally declares a type of psionic creature as the enemy she detests above all others. Due to her extensive study of her foes and training in the proper techniques for combating them, she gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against her favored enemy.Likewise, she gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against creatures of this kind. At 4th level the bonuses increase to +4, at 7th level to +6, and at 10th level to +8.</div><div topic='Enemy Sense' level='8'><b>Enemy Sense (Su):</b> A slayer can sense the presence of her favored enemy within 60 feet of herself, even if they are hidden by darkness or walls, but she cannot discern their exact location.</div><div topic='Brain Nausea' level='8'><b>Brain Nausea (Su):</b> At 2nd level, a slayer gains a constant defensive ability somewhat similar to the _aversion_ power. Any creature that attempts to eat the slayer's brain must succeed on a Will save (DC 15 + slayer's class level) or become disinclined to do so for 24 hours thereafter. A creature that fails this save may take any action it desires except extracting the slayer's brain (but does not realize it is being so affected). This ability is active even if the slayer is unconscious, stunned, or otherwise helpless.</div><div topic='Lucid Buffer' level='8'><b>Lucid Buffer (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, a slayer becomes especially skilled at resisting mental attacks. She gains a +4 competence bonus on saving throws against all compulsions and mind-affecting effects. This ability is active even if the slayer is unconscious, stunned, or otherwise helpless.</div><div topic='Cerebral Blind' level='8'><b>Cerebral Blind (Su):</b> After reaching 6th level, a slayer is protected from all devices, powers, and spells that reveal location. This ability protects against information gathering by clairsentience powers or effects that reveal location.The ability even foils _bend reality_,  _limited wish_,  _miracle_,  _reality revision_,  and _wish_ when they are used to gain information about the slayer's location (however, _metafaculty_ can pierce this protective barrier). In the case of _remote viewing_ or _scrying_ that scans an area a slayer is in, the effect works, but the slayer simply isn't detected. _remote viewing_ or _scrying_ attempts that are targeted specifically at a slayer do not work. This ability is active as long as the slayer is psionically focused.</div><div topic='Breach Power Resistance' level='8'><b>Breach Power Resistance (Su):</b> A slayer of 8th level or higher can enhance her weapon with psionic might. Each successful melee attack (or ranged attack if the target is within 30 feet) she makes with her weapon against a creature with power resistance temporarily reduces its power resistance by 1. Unless the creature is slain, its lost power resistance returns all at once 12 hours later. This ability is active as long as the slayer is psionically focused.</div><div topic='Cerebral Immunity' level='8'><b>Cerebral Immunity (Su):</b> On reaching 9th level, a slayer gains protection from all devices, powers, and spells that influence the mind. This ability shields her against almost all mind-affecting powers and effects (though the slayer can selectively allow powers or spells to affect her). The ability even foils _bend reality_, _limited wish_, _miracle_,  _reality revision_, and _wish_ when they are used to mentally influence a slayer. This ability is active as long as the slayer is psionically focused.</div><div topic='Blast Feedback' level='8'><b>Blast Feedback (Su):</b> At 10th level, if a slayer makes her saving throw when attacked with _mind blast_,  the _mind blast_ rebounds upon the attacker. Only the original attacker is targeted in the rebound effect. If the original attacker fails a Will saving throw (DC equal to that of the original attack), the attacker is affected normally by the _mind blast_.</div></div></div>    ",

topic='Class Features' level='5'><h5><b>Class Features</b></h5>All of the following are class features of the sorcerer.<div topic='Weapon and Armor Proficiency' level='8'><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a sorcerer's gestures, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.</div><div topic='Spells' level='8'><b>Spells:</b> A sorcerer casts arcane spells which are drawn primarily from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or a cleric must (see below).To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a sorcerer's spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer's Charisma modifier.Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Sorcerer. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.A sorcerer's selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new sorcerer level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known are fixed.) These new spells can be common spells chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of by study. The sorcerer can't use this method of spell acquisition to learn spells at a faster rate, however.Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a sorcerer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the sorcerer 'loses' the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level sorcerer spell the sorcerer can cast. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. He does not have to decide ahead of time which spells he'll cast.</div><div topic='Familiar' level='8'><b>Familiar:</b> A sorcerer can obtain a familiar (see below). Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant.The sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the sorcerer advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, the sorcerer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a sorcerer's experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs.A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.</div></div></div>    ",

The blade is identical in all ways (except visually) to a short sword of a size appropriate for its wielder. For instance, a Medium soulknife materializes a Medium mind blade that he can wield as a light weapon, and the blade deals 1d6 points of damage (crit 19-20/x2). Soulknives who are smaller or larger than Medium create mind blades identical to short swords appropriate for their size, with a corresponding change to the blade's damage. The wielder of a mind blade gains the usual benefits to his attack roll and damage roll from a high Strength bonus.The blade can be broken (it has hardness 10 and 10 hit points); however, a soulknife can simply create another on his next move action. The moment he relinquishes his grip on his blade, it dissipates (unless he intends to throw it; see below). A mind blade is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.A soulknife can use feats such as Power Attack or Combat Expertise in conjunction with the mind blade just as if it were a normal weapon. He can also choose mind blade for feats requiring a specific weapon choice, such as Weapon Specialization. Powers or spells that upgrade weapons can be used on a mind blade.A soulknife's mind blade improves as the character gains higher levels. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, the mind blade gains a cumulative +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls (+2 at 8th level, +3 at 12th level, +4 at 16th level, and +5 at 20th level).Even in places where psionic effects do not normally function (such as within a _null psionics field_), a soulknife can attempt to sustain his mind blade by making a DC 20 Will save. On a successful save, the soulknife maintains his mind blade for a number of rounds equal to his class level before he needs to check again. On an unsuccessful attempt, the mind blade vanishes. As a move action on his turn, the soulknife can attempt a new Will save to rematerialize his mind blade while he remains within the psionics negating effect.</div><div topic='Weapon Focus' level='8'><b>Weapon Focus (Mind Blade):</b> A soulknife gains Weapon Focus (mind blade) as a bonus feat.</div><div topic='Wild Talent' level='8'><b>Wild Talent:</b> A soulknife gains Wild Talent as a bonus feat. (This class feature provides the character with the psionic power he needs to materialize his mind blade, if he has no power points otherwise.)</div><div topic='Throw Mind Blade' level='8'><b>Throw Mind Blade (Ex):</b> A soul knife of 2nd level or higher can throw his mind blade as a ranged weapon with a range increment of 30 feet.Whether or not the attack hits, a thrown mind blade then dissipates. A soulknife of 3rd level or higher can make a psychic strike (see below) with a thrown mind blade and can use the blade in conjunction with other special abilities (such as Knife to the Soul; see below).</div><div topic='Psychic Strike' level='8'><b>Psychic Strike (Su):</b> As a move action, a soulknife of 3rd level or higher can imbue his mind blade with destructive psychic energy. This effect deals an extra 1d8 points of damage to the next living, nonmindless target he successfully hits with a melee attack (or ranged attack, if he is using the throw mind blade ability). Creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to psychic strike damage. (Unlike the rogue's sneak attack, the psychic strike is not precision damage and can affect creatures otherwise immune to extra damage from critical hits or more than 30 feet away, provided they are living, nonmindless creatures not immune to mind-affecting effects.)A mind blade deals this extra damage only once when this ability is called upon, but a soulknife can imbue his mind blade with psychic energy again by taking another move action.Once a soulknife has prepared his blade for a psychic strike, it holds the extra energy until it is used. Even if the soulknife drops the mind blade (or it otherwise dissipates, such as when it is thrown and misses), it is still imbued with psychic energy when the soulknife next materializes it.At every four levels beyond 3rd (7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th), the extra damage from a soulknife's psychic strike increases as shown on the Table above.</div><div topic='Free Draw' level='8'><b>Free Draw (Su):</b> At 5th level, a soulknife becomes able to materialize his mind blade as a free action instead of a move action. He can make only one attempt to materialize the mind blade per round, however.</div><div topic='Shape Mind Blade' level='8'><b>Shape Mind Blade (Su):</b> At 5th level, a soulknife gains the ability to change the form of his mind blade. As a fullround action, he can change his mind blade to replicate a longsword (damage 1d8 for a Medium weapon wielded as a one-handed weapon) or a bastard sword (damage 1d10 for a Medium weapon, but he must wield it as a two-handed weapon unless he knows the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (bastard sword) feat). If a soulknife shapes his mind blade into the form of a bastard sword and wields it two-handed, he adds 1-1/2 times his Strength bonus to his damage rolls, just like when using any other two-handed weapon.Alternatively, a soulknife can split his mind blade into two identical short swords, suitable for fighting with a weapon in each hand. (The normal penalties for fighting with two weapons apply.) However, both mind blades have an enhancement bonus 1 lower than the soulknife would otherwise create with a single mind blade.</div><div topic='Mind Blade Enhancement' level='8'><b>Mind Blade Enhancement (Su):</b> At 6th level, a soulknife gains the ability to enhance his mind blade. He can add any one of the weapon special abilities on the table below that has an enhancement bonus value of +1.At every four levels beyond 6th (10th, 14th, and 18th), the value of the enhancement a soulknife can add to his weapon improves to +2, +3, and +4, respectively. A soulknife can choose any combination of weapon special abilities that does not exceed the total allowed by the soulknife's level.The weapon ability or abilities remain the same every time the soulknife materializes his mind blade (unless he decides to reassign its abilities; see below). The ability or abilities apply to any form the mind blade takes, including the use of the shape mind blade or bladewind class abilities.<table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td><b>Weapon Special Ability</b><br/></td><td><b>Enhancement Bonus Value</b><br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Defending<br/></td><td>+1<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Keen<br/></td><td>+1<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Lucky*<br/></td><td>+1<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Mighty cleaving<br/></td><td>+1<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Psychokinetic*<br/></td><td>+1<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Sundering*<br/></td><td>+1<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Vicious<br/></td><td>+1<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Collision*<br/></td><td>+2<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Mindcrusher*<br/></td><td>+2<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Psychokinetic burst*<br/></td><td>+2<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Suppression*<br/></td><td>+2<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Wounding<br/></td><td>+2<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Bodyfeeder*<br/></td><td>+3<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Mindfeeder*<br/></td><td>+3<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Soulbreaker*<br/></td><td>+3<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='2'><td colspan='2'>*New special abilities<br/></td></tr></table>A soulknife can reassign the ability or abilities he has added to his mind blade.

Each fragment functions identically to the soulknife's regular mind blade.When using bladewind, a soulknife forfeits any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats or abilities (such as the Cleave feat or the _haste_ spell).The mind blade immediately reverts to its previous form after the bladewind attack.</div><div topic='Greater Weapon Focus' level='8'><b>Greater Weapon Focus (Mind Blade):</b> A soulknife gains Greater Weapon Focus (mind blade) as a bonus feat at 9th level.</div><div topic='Knife to the Soul' level='8'><b>Knife to the Soul (Su):</b> Beginning at 13th level, when a soulknife executes a psychic strike, he can choose to substitute Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage (his choice) for extra dice of damage.

A soulknife can combine extra dice of damage and ability damage in any combination.The soulknife decides which ability score his psychic strike damages and the division of ability damage and extra dice of damage when he imbues his mind blade with the psychic strike energy.</div><div topic='Multiple Throw' level='8'><b>Multiple Throw (Ex):</b> At 17th level and higher, a soulknife can throw a number of mind blades per round equal to the number of melee attacks he could make.</div></div></div>    ",

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that he adds the level of thaumaturgist to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly.If a character had more than one spellcasting class before he became a thaumaturgist, he must decide to which class he adds each level of thaumaturgist for the purpose of determining spells per day.</div><div topic='Improved Ally' level='8'><b>Improved Ally:</b> When a thaumaturgist casts a _planar ally_ spell (including the _lesser_ and _greater_ versions), he makes a Diplomacy check to convince the creature to aid him for a reduced payment. If the thaumaturgist's Diplomacy check adjusts the creature's attitude to helpful the creature will work for 50% of the standard fee, as long as the task is one that is not against its nature.The thaumaturgist's improved ally class feature only works when the planar ally shares at least one aspect of alignment with the thaumaturgist.A thaumaturgist can have only one such ally at a time, but he may bargain for tasks from other planar allies normally.</div><div topic='Augment Summoning' level='8'><b>Augment Summoning:</b> At 2nd level, a thaumaturgist gains the Augment Summoning feat.</div><div topic='Extended Summoning' level='8'><b>Extended Summoning:</b> At 3rd level and higher, all spells from the summoning subschool that the thaumaturgist casts have their durations doubled, as if the Extend Spell feat had been applied to them. The levels of the summoning spells don't change, however. This ability stacks with the effect of the Extend Spell feat, which does change the spell's level.</div><div topic='Contingent Conjuration' level='8'><b>Contingent Conjuration:</b> A 4th-level thaumaturgist can prepare a summoning or calling spell ahead of time to be triggered by some other event. This functions as described for the _contingency_ spell, including having the thaumaturgist cast the summoning or calling spell beforehand. The spell is cast instantly when the trigger event occurs.The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. If complicated or convoluted condition as are prescribed, the contingent conjuration may fail when triggered. The conjuration spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether the thaumaturgist wants it to, although most conjurations can be dismissed normally. A thaumaturgist can have only one contingent conjuration active at a time.</div><div topic='Planar Cohort' level='8'><b>Planar Cohort:</b> A 5th-level thaumaturgist can use any of the _planar ally_ spells to call a creature to act as his cohort. The called creature serves loyally and well as long as the thaumaturgist continues to advance a cause important to the creature.To call a planar cohort, the thaumaturgist must cast the relevant spell, paying the XP costs normally. It takes an offering of 1,000 gp x the HD of the creature to convince it to serve as a planar cohort, and the improved ally class feature can't be used to reduce or eliminate this cost. The planar cohort can't have more Hit Dice than the thaumaturgist has, and must have an ECL no higher than the thaumaturgist's character level -2.A thaumaturgist can have only one planar cohort at a time, but he can continue to make agreements with other called creatures normally. A planar cohort replaces a thaumaturgist's existing cohort, if he has one by virtue of the Leadership feat.</div></div></div>    ",

This essentially means that she adds the level of thrallherd to the level of whatever manifesting class the character has, then determines power points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly.If a character had more than one manifesting class before she became a thrallherd, she must decide to which class she adds the new level of thrallherd for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester level.</div><div topic='Thrallherd' level='8'><b>Thrallherd (Ex):</b> A thrallherd who has just entered the class sends out a subtle psychic call for servants, and that call is answered. Essentially, the character gains something akin to the Leadership feat, but with some important differences.Those who answer a thrallherd's call are not referred to as cohorts and followers, but rather as thralls and believers, respectively. They do not appear because they admire the character and want to serve her, but because a hidden psychic resonance connects the thrallherd and her servants.As with the Leadership feat, a thrallherd has a Leadership score that determines the highest-level thrall and believers she can attract. A thrallherd's Leadership score is equal to her character level + her Cha modifier + her thrallherd level. (Note that her thrallherd level is counted twice.) This score is not affected by any of the modifiers mentioned in the Leadership feat.As with the Leadership feat, the called thrall's level is limited, even if the character's Leadership score would indicate a higher-level thrall. Unlike with the Leadership feat, the level limit of a thrall is equal to the character's total level minus 1 (not level minus 2, as is true for cohorts).A thrallherd cannot take the Leadership feat; if the character already has it, the feat is lost and replaced by this ability; those who were previously cohorts and followers go their separate ways, and those who are more mentally pliable show up later to take up roles as thralls and believers. A thrallherd's first thrall and believers arrive within 24 hours of her entry into this class; likewise, lost thralls and believers are replaced within 24 hours.Use the following table instead of the one with the Leadership feat to determine the level of a thrallherd's thrall and the number of believers of various levels a thrallherd can attract.<table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'><tr maxcol='9' curcol='4'><td><b>Leadership Score</b> <br/></td> <td><b>Thrall Level</b><br/></td><td colspan='6' align='center'><b>- Number of Believers by Level -</b><br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td/><td/><td><b>1st</b><br/></td><td><b>2nd</b><br/></td><td><b>3rd</b><br/></td><td><b>4th</b><br/></td><td><b>5th</b><br/></td><td><b>6th</b><br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>1 or lower<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>2<br/></td><td>1st<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>3<br/></td><td>2nd<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>4<br/></td><td>3rd<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>5<br/></td><td>3rd<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>6<br/></td><td>4th<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>7<br/></td><td>5th<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>8<br/></td><td>5th<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>9<br/></td><td>6th<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>10<br/></td><td>7th<br/></td><td>5<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>11<br/></td><td>7th<br/></td><td>6<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>12<br/></td><td>8th<br/></td><td>8<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>13<br/></td><td>9th<br/></td><td>10<br/></td><td>1<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>14<br/></td><td>10th<br/></td><td>15<br/></td><td>1<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>15<br/></td><td>10th<br/></td><td>20<br/></td><td>2<br/></td><td>1<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>16<br/></td><td>11th<br/></td><td>25<br/></td><td>2<br/></td><td>1<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>17<br/></td><td>12th<br/></td><td>30<br/></td><td>3<br/></td><td>1<br/></td><td>1<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>18<br/></td><td>12th<br/></td><td>35<br/></td><td>3<br/></td><td>1<br/></td><td>1<br/></td><td>-<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>19<br/></td><td>13th<br/></td><td>40<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>2<br/></td><td>1<br/></td><td>1<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>20<br/></td><td>14th<br/></td><td>50<br/></td><td>5<br/></td><td>3<br/></td><td>2<br/></td><td>1<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>21<br/></td><td>15th<br/></td><td>60<br/></td><td>6<br/></td><td>3<br/></td><td>2<br/></td><td>1<br/></td><td>1<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>22<br/></td><td>15th<br/></td><td>75<br/></td><td>7<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>2<br/></td><td>2<br/></td><td>1<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>23<br/></td><td>16th<br/></td><td>90<br/></td><td>9<br/></td><td>5<br/></td><td>3<br/></td><td>2<br/></td><td>1<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>24<br/></td><td>17th<br/></td><td>110<br/></td><td>11<br/></td><td>6<br/></td><td>3<br/></td><td>2<br/></td><td>1<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='9' curcol='9'><td>25 or higher<br/></td><td>17th<br/></td><td>135<br/></td><td>13<br/></td><td>7<br/></td><td>4<br/></td><td>2<br/></td><td>2<br/></td></tr></table></div><div topic='Psionic Charm' level='8'><b>Psionic Charm (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, a thrallherd adds _psionic charm_ to her powers known (if she doesn't already know it).

His ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table: The War Mind. In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Wisdom score. His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items. If a war mind has power points from a different class, those points are pooled together and usable to manifest powers from either class. Bonus power points from having a high ability score can be gained only for the character's highest psionic class.</div><div topic='Powers Known' level='8'><b>Powers Known:</b> A war mind chooses his powers from the psychic warrior power list. At 1st level, a war mind knows one psychic warrior power of your choice. At every even-numbered level higher than 1st, he learns one new power. A war mind can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester level. The total number of powers a war mind can manifest per day is limited only by his daily power points.A war mind simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the way that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though he must get a good night's sleep each day to regain all his spent power points.The Difficulty Class for saving throws against war mind powers is 10 + the power's level + the war mind's Wisdom modifier.</div><div topic='Maximum Power Level Known' level='8'><b>Maximum Power Level Known:</b> A war mind gains the ability to learn one 1st-level power when he takes his first level in the prestige class. As he attains each even-numbered level beyond 2nd, a war mind gains the ability to master more complex powers.To learn or manifest a power, a war mind must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the power's level.</div><div topic='Chain of Personal Superiority' level='8'><b>Chain of Personal Superiority (Ex):</b> At 1st level, a war mind learns the first principle of warfare for the individual combatant: the ability to both deal punishment and take it. Calling upon inner reserves of knowledge and dedication, a war mind can provide himself with a +2 insight bonus to Strength and Constitution for up to 1 minute. A war mind can use this power three times per day. Activating this power is a free action. At 7th level, the insight bonus to Strength and Constitution improves to +4.</div><div topic='Chain of Defensive Posture' level='8'><b>Chain of Defensive Posture (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, a war mind learns the second principle of warfare for the individual combatant: the ability to avoid the enemy's counterattacks if that enemy is not immediately overwhelmed. Calling upon inner reserves of knowledge and dedication, a war mind can provide himself with a +2 insight bonus to Armor Class for up to 1 minute. A war mind can use this power three times per day. Activating this power is a free action. At 8th level, the insight bonus to Armor Class improves to +4.</div><div topic='Enduring Body' level='8'><b>Enduring Body (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, a war mind learns the third principle of warfare for the individual combatant: to unleash in oneself the spirit of the enduring body. The spirit of the ideal body transforms a war mind, granting him damage reduction 1/-. At 6th level, his damage reduction improves to 2/-. At 9th level, his damage reduction improves to 3/-.</div><div topic='Sweeping Strike' level='8'><b>Sweeping Strike (Ex):</b> At 5th level, a war mind gains the ability to make great, sweeping swings with a melee weapon. On each melee attack a war mind makes, he can choose squares he threatens that are adjacent to each other, and his attacks apply to creatures in those two squares equally. A war mind can use this ability on any attack, even an attack of opportunity or a cleave attempt.A war mind cannot use this ability if he has moved more than 10 feet since the end of his last turn. If a war mind drops one or both of his foes with a sweeping strike, he can attempt a cleave normally; however, he makes only one cleave attempt per sweeping strike, even if he drops more than one foe.</div><div topic='Chain of Overwhelming Force' level='8'><b>Chain of Overwhelming Force (Su):</b> At 10th level, a war mind learns the fourth principle of warfare for the individual combatant: to discover the underlying violence of the world and deliver it in a perfectly executed attack.The war mind taps into this underlying energy and apply it to a single attack, dealing an extra 10d6 points of damage. A war mind can use this power once per day. Activating this power is a free action. If the attack misses, the power is wasted.</div></div></div>    ",

wilder.<div topic='Weapon and Armor Proficiency' level='8'><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Wilders are proficient with all simple weapons, with light armor, and with shields (except tower shields).</div><div topic='Power Points/Day' level='8'><b>Power Points/Day:</b> A wilder's ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points she has available. Her base daily allotment of power points is given on Table: The Wilder. In addition, she receives bonus power points per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points). Her race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items.</div><div topic='Powers Known' level='8'><b>Powers Known:</b> A wilder begins play knowing one wilder power of your choice. At every even-numbered class level after 1st, she unlocks the knowledge of new powers.Choose the powers known from the wilder power list. (_Exception:_ The feats Expanded Knowledge and Epic Expanded Knowledge do allow a wilder to learn powers from the lists of other classes.) A wilder can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than her manifester level.The total number of powers a wilder can manifest in a day is limited only by her daily power points.A wilder simply knows her powers; they are ingrained in her mind. She does not need to prepare them (in the way that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though she must get a good night's sleep each day to regain all her spent power points.The Difficulty Class for saving throws against wilder powers is 10 + the power's level + the wilder's Charisma modifier.</div><div topic='Maximum Power Level Known' level='8'><b>Maximum Power Level Known:</b> A wilder begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level powers. As she attains higher levels, she may gain the ability to master more complex powers.To learn or manifest a power, a wilder must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the power's level.</div><div topic='Wild Surge' level='8'><b>Wild Surge (Su)</b>: A wilder can let her passion and emotion rise to the surface in a wild surge when she manifests a power. During a wild surge, a wilder gains phenomenal psionic strength, but may harm herself by the reckless use of her power (see Psychic Enervation, below).A wilder can choose to invoke a wild surge whenever she manifests a power. When she does so, she gains +1 to her manifester level with that manifestation of the power. The manifester level boost gives her the ability to augment her powers to a higher degree than she otherwise could; however, she pays no extra power point for this wild surge. Instead, the additional 1 power point that would normally be required to augment the power is effectively supplied by the wild surge.Level-dependent power effects are also improved, depending on the power a wilder manifests with her wild surge.This improvement in manifester level does not grant her any other benefits (psicrystal abilities do not advance, she does not gain higher-level class abilities, and so on).She cannot use the Overchannel psionic feat and invoke her wild surge at the same time.At 3rd level, a wilder can choose to boost her manifester level by two instead of one. At 7th level, she can boost her manifester level by up to three; at 11th level, by up to four; at 15th level, by up to five; and at 19th level, by up to six.In all cases, the wild surge effectively pays the extra power point cost that is normally required to augment the power; only the unaugmented power point cost is subtracted from the wilder's power point reserve.</div><div topic='Psychic Enervation' level='8'><b>Psychic Enervation (Ex):</b> Pushing oneself by invoking a wild surge is dangerous. Immediately following each wild surge, a wilder may be overcome by the strain of her effort. The chance of suffering psychic enervation is equal to 5% per manifester level added with the wild surge.A wilder who is overcome by psychic enervation is dazed until the end of her next turn and loses a number of power points equal to her wilder level.</div><div topic='Elude Touch' level='8'><b>Elude Touch (Ex):</b> Starting at 2nd level, a wilder's intuition supersedes her intellect, alerting her to danger from touch attacks (including rays). She gains a bonus to Armor Class against all touch attacks equal to her Charisma bonus; however, her touch AC can never exceed her Armor Class against normal attacks.</div><div topic='Surging Euphoria' level='8'><b>Surging Euphoria (Ex):</b> Starting at 4th level, when a wilder uses her wild surge ability, she gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to the intensity of her wild surge.If a wilder is overcome by psychic enervation following her wild surge, she does not gain the morale bonus for this use of her wild surge ability.At 12th level, the morale bonus on a wilder's attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws increases to +2. At 20th level, the bonus increases to +3.</div><div topic='Volatile Mind' level='8'><b>Volatile Mind (Ex):</b> A wilder's temperamental mind is hard to encompass with the discipline of telepathy. When any telepathy power is manifested on a wilder of 5th level or higher, the manifester of the power must pay 1 power point more than he otherwise would have spent.The extra cost is not a natural part of that power's cost. It does not augment the power; it is simply a wasted power point. The wilder's volatile mind can force the manifester of the telepathy power to exceed the normal power point limit of 1 point per manifester level. If the extra cost raises the telepathy power's cost to more points than the manifester has remaining in his reserve, the power simply fails, and the manifester exhausts the rest of his power points.At 9th level, the penalty assessed against telepathy powers manifested on a wilder is increased to 2 power points. At 13th level, the penalty increases to 3 power points, and at 17th level it increases to 4 power points.As a standard action, a wilder can choose to lower this effect for 1 round.</div></div></div>    ",

At each such opportunity, she can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard is not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell Mastery when choosing these feats.</div><div topic='Spellbooks' level='8'><b>Spellbooks:</b> A wizard must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for _read magic_, which all wizards can prepare from memory.A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from her prohibited school or schools, if any; see School Specialization, below) plus three 1st-level spells of your choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the wizard has, the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice. At each new wizard level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new wizard level) for her spellbook. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards' spellbooks to her own.</div></div><div topic='School Specialization' level='3'>*School Specialization*A school is one of eight groupings of spells, each defined by a common theme. If desired, a wizard may specialize in one school of magic (see below). Specialization allows a wizard to cast extra spells from her chosen school, but she then never learns to cast spells from some other schools.A specialist wizard can prepare one additional spell of her specialty school per spell level each day. She also gains a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn the spells of her chosen school.The wizard must choose whether to specialize and, if she does so, choose her specialty at 1st level. At this time, she must also give up two other schools of magic (unless she chooses to specialize in divination; see below), which become her prohibited schools.A wizard can never give up divination to fulfill this requirement.Spells of the prohibited school or schools are not available to the wizard, and she can't even cast such spells from scrolls or fire them from wands. She may not change either her specialization or her prohibited schools later.The eight schools of arcane magic are abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation.Spells that do not fall into any of these schools are called universal spells._Abjuration:_ Spells that protect, block, or banish. An abjuration specialist is called an abjurer._Conjuration:_ Spells that bring creatures or materials to the caster. A conjuration specialist is called a conjurer._Divination:_ Spells that reveal information. A divination specialist is called a diviner. Unlike the other specialists, a diviner must give up only one other school._Enchantment:_ Spells that imbue the recipient with some property or grant the caster power over another being. An enchantment specialist is called an enchanter._Evocation:_ Spells that manipulate energy or create something from nothing. An evocation specialist is called an evoker._Illusion:_ Spells that alter perception or create false images. An illusion specialist is called an illusionist._Necromancy:_ Spells that manipulate, create, or destroy life or life force. A necromancy specialist is called a necromancer._Transmutation:_ Spells that transform the recipient physically or change its properties in a more subtle way. A transmutation specialist is called a transmuter._Universal:_ Not a school, but a category for spells that all wizards can learn. A wizard cannot select universal as a specialty school or as a prohibited school. Only a limited number of spells fall into this category.</div><div topic='Familiars' level='3'>*Familiars*A familiar is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical beast when summoned to service by a sorcerer or wizard. It retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skills, and feats of the normal animal it once was, but it is treated as a magical beast instead of an animal for the purpose of any effect that depends on its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a familiar. An animal companion cannot also function as a familiar.A familiar also grants special abilities to its master (a sorcerer or wizard), as given on the table below. These special abilities apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other.Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend on the master's level.<table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td><b>Familiar</b><br/></td> <td><b>Special</b><br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Bat<br/></td><td>Master gains a +3 bonus on Listen checks<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Cat<br/></td><td>Master gains a +3 bonus on Move Silently checks<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Hawk<br/></td><td>Master gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in bright light<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Lizard<br/></td><td>Master gains a +3 bonus on Climb checks<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Owl<br/></td><td>Master gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in shadows<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Rat<br/></td><td>Master gains a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Raven<br/></td><td>Master gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Snake<br/></td><td>Master gains a +3 bonus on Bluff checks<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Toad<br/></td><td>Master gains +3 hit points<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'><td>Weasel<br/></td><td>Master gains a +2 bonus on Reflex saves<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='2'><td colspan='2'>1 A raven familiar can speak one language of its master's choice as a supernatural ability.<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='3' curcol='2'><td colspan='2'>2 Tiny viper.<br/></td></tr></table><div topic='Familiar Basics' level='8'><b>Familiar Basics:</b> Use the basic statistics for a creature of the familiar's kind, but make the following changes:_Hit Dice:_ For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice, use the master's character level or the familiar's normal HD total, whichever is higher._Hit Points:_ The familiar has one-half the master's total hit points (not including temporary hit points), rounded down, regardless of its actual Hit Dice._Attacks:_ Use the master's base attack bonus, as calculated from all his classes. Use the familiar's Dexterity or Strength modifier, whichever is greater, to get the familiar's melee attack bonus with natural weapons.Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar's kind._Saving Throws:_ For each saving throw, use either the familiar's base save bonus (Fortitude +2, Reflex +2, Will +0) or the master's (as calculated from all his classes), whichever is better. The familiar uses its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any of the other bonuses that the master might have on saves._Skills:_ For each skill in which either the master or the familiar has ranks, use either the normal skill ranks for an animal of that type or the master's skill ranks, whichever are better. In either case, the familiar uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless of a familiar's total skill modifiers, some skills may remain beyond the familiar's ability to use.</div><div topic='Familiar Ability Descriptions' level='8'><b>Familiar Ability Descriptions:</b> All familiars have special abilities (or impart abilities to their masters) depending on the master's combined level in classes that grant familiars, as shown on the table below. The abilities given on the table are cumulative._Natural Armor Adj.:_ The number noted here is an improvement to the familiar's existing natural armor bonus._Int:_ The familiar's Intelligence score._Alertness (Ex):_ While a familiar is within arm's reach, the master gains the Alertness feat._Improved Evasion (Ex):_ When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw fails._Share Spells:_ At the master's option, he may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also affect his familiar. The familiar must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit.If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the familiar if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the familiar again even if it returns to the master before the duration expires. Additionally, the master may cast a spell with a target of 'You' on his familiar (as a touch range spell) instead of on himself.A master and his familiar can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the familiar's type (magical beast)._Empathic Link (Su):_ The master has an empathic link with his familiar out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The master cannot see through the familiar's eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Because of the limited nature of the link, only general emotional content can be communicated.Because of this empathic link, the master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar does._Deliver Touch Spells (Su):_ If the master is 3rd level or higher, a familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the 'toucher.' The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master could. As usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates._Speak with Master (Ex):_ If the master is 5th level or higher, a familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help._Speak with Animals of Its Kind (Ex):_ If the master is 7th level or higher, a familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire varieties): bats with bats, rats with rodents, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, toads with amphibians, weasels with similar creatures (weasels, minks, polecats, ermines, skunks, wolverines, and badgers). Such communication is limited by the intelligence of the conversing creatures._Spell Resistance (Ex):_ If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5. To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the familiar's spell resistance._Scry on Familiar (Sp):_ If the master is 13th level or higher, he may scry on his familiar (as if casting the _scrying_ spell) once per day.<table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td><b>Master Class Level</b> <br/></td> <td><b>Natural Armor Adj</b>. <br/></td><td><b>Int</b> <br/></td><td><b>Special</b><br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>1st-2nd<br/></td><td>+1<br/></td><td>6<br/></td><td>Alertness, improved evasion, share spells, empathic link<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>3rd-4th<br/></td><td>+2<br/></td><td>7<br/></td><td>Deliver touch spells<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>5th-6th<br/></td><td>+3<br/></td><td>8<br/></td><td>Speak with master<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>7th-8th<br/></td><td>+4<br/></td><td>9<br/></td><td>Speak with animals of its kind<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>9th-10th<br/></td><td>+5<br/></td><td>10<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>11th-12th<br/></td><td>+6<br/></td><td>11<br/></td><td>Spell resistance<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>13th-14th<br/></td><td>+7<br/></td><td>12<br/></td><td>_Scry_ on familiar<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>15th-16th<br/></td><td>+8<br/></td><td>13<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>17th-18th<br/></td><td>+9<br/></td><td>14<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr><tr maxcol='5' curcol='5'><td>19th-20th<br/></td><td>+10<br/></td><td>15<br/></td><td>-<br/></td></tr></table></div></div><div topic='Arcane Spells and Armor' level='3'>*Arcane Spells and Armor*Wizards and sorcerers do not know how to wear armor effectively.If desired, they can wear armor anyway (though they'll be clumsy in it), or they can gain training in the proper use of armor (with the various Armor Proficiency feats-light, medium, and heavy-and the Shield Proficiency feat), or they can multiclass to add a class that grants them armor proficiency. Even if a wizard or sorcerer is wearing armor with which he or she is proficient, however, it might still interfere with spellcasting.Armor restricts the complicated gestures that a wizards or sorcerer must make while casting any spell that has a somatic component (most do). The armor and shield descriptions list the arcane spell failure chance for different armors and shields.By contrast, bards not only know how to wear light armor effectively, but they can also ignore the arcane spell failure chance for such armor. A bard wearing armor heavier than light or using any type of shield incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance, even if he becomes proficient with that armor.If a spell doesn't have a somatic component, an arcane spellcaster can cast it with no problem while wearing armor. Such spells can also be cast even if the caster's hands are bound or if he or she is grappling (although Concentration checks still apply normally). Also, the metamagic feat Still Spell allows a spellcaster to prepare or cast a spell at one spell level higher than normal without the somatic component. This also provides a way to cast a spell while wearing armor without risking arcane spell failure.</div></div>    ",
